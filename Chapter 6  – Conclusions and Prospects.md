# Chapter 6 Conclusions and Prospects

## 6.1 Conclusions

This study developed an integrated framework for counterparty credit risk assessment by combining the KMV structural model with GARCH-based volatility dynamics. Applying this framework to major U.S. financial institutions over the 2018–2024 period yielded several significant findings.

The empirical results confirm that Distance to Default effectively differentiates solvency positions across institutions. Well-capitalized banks with lower equity volatility—such as JPMorgan Chase and PNC Financial—consistently exhibited higher DD values and greater financial resilience, while smaller or more leveraged counterparties displayed narrower safety margins. This validates DD as a real-time, market-responsive indicator that bridges traditional balance-sheet metrics and forward-looking market assessments.

The analysis also demonstrates a robust inverse relationship between equity volatility and DD. Elevated market volatility directly compresses default distances, reflecting heightened uncertainty regarding asset values. This finding underscores the importance of embedding dynamic volatility processes into CCR measurement frameworks to capture time-varying risk that static models overlook.
From a practical perspective, the KMV-GARCH metrics can be operationalized within institutional risk management infrastructures. The proposed quantile-based classification system enables dynamic adjustment of counterparty exposures, aligning internal risk limits with continuously updating market signals. Portfolio-level DD distributions also provide supervisory authorities with systemic perspectives on sectoral solvency, supporting early-warning mechanisms under Basel III.
The framework demonstrates that properly calibrated market information serves as a valuable complement to traditional credit analysis and regulatory capital measurement. By providing both institution-specific and systemic risk insights, the model contributes to a more responsive and empirically grounded approach to counterparty credit risk management in modern financial institutions.

## 6.2 Limitations and Outlook

The analysis relies exclusively on publicly available market data—equity prices, financial statement items, and Treasury yields—which may not fully capture private credit exposures, off-balance-sheet derivative positions, or intraday liquidity dynamics. Future research could enhance model precision by incorporating more granular datasets, such as bilateral counterparty exposure records, repo transaction data, or credit default swap spreads.

The KMV structural framework also imposes certain modeling simplifications. The default point is approximated as a linear combination of short- and long-term debt, while asset values are inferred through an iterative procedure rather than directly observed. Alternative approaches—such as Merton models with jump-diffusion processes or copula-based frameworks—may better capture tail risk, nonlinear dependencies, and sudden credit events that continuous-time diffusion models underestimate.
The GARCH(1,1) specification employed in this study, while widely validated, may inadequately represent volatility dynamics during extreme market stress. Extensions using asymmetric GARCH variants (such as EGARCH or GJR-GARCH) or regime-switching models could improve the framework's ability to capture leverage effects, volatility persistence asymmetry, and contagion channels during crisis periods.

The scope of this study is limited to U.S. banking institutions. Extending the analysis to a broader cross-country context—encompassing European, Asian, or emerging market financial systems—would provide valuable insights into how regulatory environments, market structures, and accounting standards affect the performance and calibration of the KMV-GARCH model. Such comparative research would help assess the framework's robustness and adaptability across diverse institutional settings.
This research establishes a methodological and empirical foundation for integrating market-based structural models into counterparty credit risk assessment. Future extensions incorporating high-frequency data, sophisticated volatility specifications, and multi-jurisdictional calibration can advance the development of more adaptive and forward-looking risk measurement frameworks, benefiting both financial practitioners and regulatory supervisors in an increasingly complex and interconnected financial landscape.
