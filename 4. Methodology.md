## 4.1 Research Design and Approach

This chapter outlines the methodological framework developed to estimate Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and analyze the effects of netting and collateralization on counterparty credit exposure. Building on the regulatory and theoretical foundation established in previous chapters, the methodology follows a quantitative, simulation-based approach designed to replicate the exposure dynamics observed in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading. The objective is to construct a flexible model capable of capturing the stochastic nature of market variables, while remaining conceptually aligned with the Internal Model Method (IMM) under the Basel framework.

The overall research design adopts a quantitative simulation approach, specifically the Monte Carlo technique, to estimate the evolution of potential future exposures over time. This approach allows for the explicit modeling of uncertainty in market risk factors, such as interest rates or foreign exchange rates, which directly affect the mark-to-market values of derivative positions. Unlike standardized methods that rely on fixed conversion factors or supervisory multipliers, the simulation framework generates exposure paths based on stochastic processes, producing a distribution of outcomes rather than a single deterministic estimate. This enables a more realistic and risk-sensitive representation of counterparty exposure (Gregory, 2015; Glasserman, 2003).

The simulation procedure follows a structured sequence. First, stochastic processes are used to model the evolution of relevant market variables—for example, short-term interest rates or swap rates—over discrete time intervals. Second, the resulting simulated price paths are applied to compute the future values of derivative positions within each simulation scenario. Third, exposures are determined as the positive part of these future portfolio values, aggregated across all simulated paths to produce the expected exposure (EE) at each time step. Finally, the time-weighted average of EE, known as the expected positive exposure (EPE), is derived to represent the overall exposure profile of the portfolio. This process mirrors the structure used in the Basel Internal Model Method, where exposure at default (EAD) is defined as:

EAD = α × EEPE,

where α = 1.4 serves as a prudential scaling factor and EEPE represents the effective expected positive exposure (BCBS, 2011).

The simulation-based model offers several advantages over analytical or standardized approaches. First, it captures the path dependency inherent in many derivative instruments, where exposure depends on the historical trajectory of underlying market factors. Second, it allows for the incorporation of non-linear payoffs, such as options or structured swaps, which are difficult to model using static add-ons. Third, it provides a natural platform for integrating collateral and netting effects, which can be incorporated as conditional adjustments at each simulation step. Through these features, the Monte Carlo framework delivers a holistic view of counterparty risk that reflects both market dynamics and contractual risk mitigants (Brigo & Morini, 2010).

Conceptually, the research design aligns with the Internal Model Method (IMM) introduced under Basel II and refined in Basel III. Both approaches rely on forward-looking simulation of potential exposures to estimate regulatory capital requirements for counterparty credit risk. However, the purpose of this study is not regulatory compliance per se, but rather to use a similar modeling structure for analytical insight. By isolating the key components of the IMM—exposure dynamics, default probabilities, and discounting—the model provides a simplified but conceptually faithful representation of how banks assess CVA internally (BCBS, 2011; Mathur & Skoglund, 2013).

In this framework, counterparty credit risk is modeled as a two-dimensional process driven by both market risk and credit risk. Market risk determines the potential exposure (through simulated portfolio values), while credit risk determines the likelihood of counterparty default. The interaction between these two processes gives rise to the expected loss due to counterparty default, which is the essence of CVA. The CVA itself is computed as the discounted expected loss from counterparty default events over the lifetime of the portfolio:

CVA = (1 − R) × ∫<sub>t=0</sub><sup>T</sup> DF(t) × EE(t) × dPD(t),

where *R* is the recovery rate, *DF(t)* is the discount factor at time *t*, *EE(t)* is the expected exposure, and *PD(t)* is the cumulative default probability up to time *t*. This continuous-time expression provides the theoretical foundation for the numerical implementation that follows in subsequent sections.

The research approach is deductive and model-driven, combining established theoretical models with simulation-based numerical techniques. It begins with defining the mathematical representation of credit exposure, followed by model calibration, simulation execution, and sensitivity testing. The analytical focus is not on achieving empirical prediction but on exploring the internal consistency and regulatory implications of exposure modeling. As such, the study emphasizes the structure and logic of the CVA estimation process rather than empirical back-testing against observed market data.

Finally, this chapter also serves to connect the quantitative modeling exercise with the regulatory themes discussed earlier. By implementing a simulation-based exposure model inspired by Basel’s IMM, the analysis bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and regulatory application. The resulting framework allows for a comparative evaluation of how netting and collateral mechanisms—central to the post-crisis regulatory environment—affect counterparty exposure and CVA outcomes. The following sections provide detailed descriptions of the model’s theoretical basis, simulation procedures, and computational implementation.


## 4.2 Model Framework and Theoretical Basis

The analytical foundation of this research lies in the quantitative modeling of counterparty credit exposure and the estimation of Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) through simulation. This section outlines the theoretical framework that connects market risk, credit risk, and the valuation of derivative portfolios. The model is based on well-established principles from financial mathematics and counterparty risk management, adapted to the context of regulatory approaches such as the Internal Model Method (IMM).

### 4.2.1 Conceptual Overview

The CVA represents the market value of counterparty credit risk embedded in a derivative or a portfolio of derivatives. In economic terms, it corresponds to the present value of expected losses arising from the potential default of a counterparty before contract maturity. Mathematically, CVA can be expressed as:

CVA = (1 − R) × ∫<sub>t=0</sub><sup>T</sup> DF(t) × EE(t) × dPD(t),

where:

- *R* is the recovery rate upon default,  
- *DF(t)* is the discount factor at time *t*,  
- *EE(t)* is the expected exposure at time *t*, and  
- *PD(t)* is the cumulative default probability up to time *t*.  

This formulation highlights the three core dimensions of CVA estimation: exposure modeling, default probability modeling, and discounting. Each component is derived from a distinct theoretical foundation, which together determine the magnitude and dynamics of counterparty credit risk.

### 4.2.2 Exposure Modeling

Exposure modeling aims to estimate the potential loss faced by a financial institution if a counterparty defaults at a future date. The instantaneous exposure *E(t)* is defined as the positive part of the portfolio’s market value:

E(t) = max[V(t), 0],

where *V(t)* represents the mark-to-market value of the portfolio at time *t*. Since future market values are uncertain, exposures are modeled as random variables driven by the stochastic evolution of market factors such as interest rates, exchange rates, or equity prices.

To capture this uncertainty, the Monte Carlo simulation framework assumes that market factors follow stochastic processes, typically modeled as Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) or similar diffusion processes:

dS<sub>t</sub> = μS<sub>t</sub>dt + σS<sub>t</sub>dW<sub>t</sub>,

where *S<sub>t</sub>* is the underlying market variable, *μ* is the drift term, *σ* is the volatility, and *W<sub>t</sub>* is a standard Wiener process. The simulated paths of *S<sub>t</sub>* are then used to compute the corresponding *V(t)* and *E(t)* for each scenario. Averaging across all simulated paths yields the expected exposure:

EE(t) = 𝔼[max(V(t), 0)].

From this, two related measures are derived:

- **Expected Positive Exposure (EPE)** – the time-weighted average of EE(t) over the life of the contract.  
- **Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EEPE)** – a regulatory measure under Basel that adjusts EPE for the decline in exposure due to contractual maturity.  

The exposure at default (EAD) used for capital calculation is then defined as:

EAD = α × EEPE,

where α = 1.4 acts as a prudential scaling factor (BCBS, 2011).

### 4.2.3 Default Probability and Credit Risk Modeling

Default probabilities are derived from the term structure of credit spreads or default intensities. In a reduced-form framework, the probability of default up to time *t* is modeled as:

PD(t) = 1 − exp(−∫<sub>0</sub><sup>t</sup> λ(s)ds),

where *λ(s)* represents the default intensity (or hazard rate) of the counterparty. This formulation assumes that default follows a Poisson process with a time-dependent intensity parameter. The term structure of *λ(s)* can be obtained from observable market data, such as Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads or corporate bond yields, using standard bootstrapping techniques (Duffie & Singleton, 2012).

For the purposes of this study, the default intensity is treated as an exogenous input derived from an assumed credit curve. This simplification isolates the exposure modeling process from credit risk calibration, allowing a clear analysis of how exposure dynamics—rather than credit estimation—drive CVA outcomes. The incremental probability of default between two adjacent time steps *t<sub>i−1</sub>* and *t<sub>i</sub>* can be approximated as:

ΔPD(t<sub>i</sub>) = PD(t<sub>i</sub>) − PD(t<sub>i−1</sub>).

This discrete approximation enables the computation of CVA as a weighted sum of expected exposures across time intervals.

### 4.2.4 Discounting and Present Value Calculation

Discounting translates future expected losses into present value terms. The discount factor *DF(t)* is determined by the risk-free yield curve, typically based on overnight indexed swap (OIS) rates or short-term government securities. The relationship is given by:

DF(t) = exp(−∫<sub>0</sub><sup>t</sup> r(s)ds),

where *r(s)* denotes the instantaneous risk-free rate. In practice, the yield curve can be assumed deterministic or simulated jointly with other market variables to capture interest rate uncertainty. The latter approach is adopted in this study, enabling consistency between exposure simulation and discounting.

### 4.2.5 Integrated CVA Framework

Combining the above components, the model computes CVA as the discounted expectation of losses due to counterparty default:

CVA = (1 − R) × Σ<sub>i=1</sub><sup>N</sup> DF(t<sub>i</sub>) × EE(t<sub>i</sub>) × ΔPD(t<sub>i</sub>).

Each term in this discrete-time summation captures a specific aspect of credit risk:  
- *DF(t<sub>i</sub>)* adjusts for the time value of money,  
- *EE(t<sub>i</sub>)* represents the potential exposure at that time, and  
- *ΔPD(t<sub>i</sub>)* captures the incremental default probability.  

This decomposition not only facilitates computational implementation but also provides analytical transparency regarding how exposure, discounting, and default risk interact in determining CVA.

### 4.2.6 Model Assumptions and Simplifications

To maintain tractability, several assumptions are adopted:  
1. **Single-Counterparty Framework** – the model focuses on one representative counterparty to isolate key risk drivers.  
2. **Single-Asset Class Exposure** – interest rate derivatives are used as the illustrative case due to their prevalence and analytical simplicity.  
3. **Exogenous Credit Curve** – credit spreads and default probabilities are assumed externally calibrated and independent of simulated market variables.  
4. **Constant Recovery Rate** – a fixed recovery rate (e.g., 40%) is assumed for simplicity.  
5. **Absence of Wrong-Way Risk** – the correlation between counterparty credit quality and exposure is not modeled explicitly.

While these assumptions limit realism, they ensure conceptual clarity and computational feasibility. The focus of this research is to demonstrate the methodology for exposure simulation and CVA computation rather than to reproduce specific market outcomes.

### 4.2.7 Summary

This model framework establishes the theoretical foundation for the subsequent simulation procedures. By integrating stochastic market dynamics, exposure estimation, default probabilities, and discounting, it provides a coherent structure for quantifying counterparty credit risk in a manner consistent with both financial theory and regulatory practice. The next section describes the practical implementation of this framework through Monte Carlo simulation and explains how exposure profiles are generated and aggregated to compute expected positive exposure (EPE) and CVA.
