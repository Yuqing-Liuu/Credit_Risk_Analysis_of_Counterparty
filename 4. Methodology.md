## 4.1 Research Design and Approach

This chapter outlines the methodological framework developed to estimate Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and analyze the effects of netting and collateralization on counterparty credit exposure. Building on the regulatory and theoretical foundation established in previous chapters, the methodology follows a quantitative, simulation-based approach designed to replicate the exposure dynamics observed in over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading. The objective is to construct a flexible model capable of capturing the stochastic nature of market variables, while remaining conceptually aligned with the Internal Model Method (IMM) under the Basel framework.

The overall research design adopts a quantitative simulation approach, specifically the Monte Carlo technique, to estimate the evolution of potential future exposures over time. This approach allows for the explicit modeling of uncertainty in market risk factors, such as interest rates or foreign exchange rates, which directly affect the mark-to-market values of derivative positions. Unlike standardized methods that rely on fixed conversion factors or supervisory multipliers, the simulation framework generates exposure paths based on stochastic processes, producing a distribution of outcomes rather than a single deterministic estimate. This enables a more realistic and risk-sensitive representation of counterparty exposure (Gregory, 2015; Glasserman, 2003).

The simulation procedure follows a structured sequence. First, stochastic processes are used to model the evolution of relevant market variables—for example, short-term interest rates or swap rates—over discrete time intervals. Second, the resulting simulated price paths are applied to compute the future values of derivative positions within each simulation scenario. Third, exposures are determined as the positive part of these future portfolio values, aggregated across all simulated paths to produce the expected exposure (EE) at each time step. Finally, the time-weighted average of EE, known as the expected positive exposure (EPE), is derived to represent the overall exposure profile of the portfolio. This process mirrors the structure used in the Basel Internal Model Method, where exposure at default (EAD) is defined as:

EAD = α × EEPE,

where α = 1.4 serves as a prudential scaling factor and EEPE represents the effective expected positive exposure (BCBS, 2011).

The simulation-based model offers several advantages over analytical or standardized approaches. First, it captures the path dependency inherent in many derivative instruments, where exposure depends on the historical trajectory of underlying market factors. Second, it allows for the incorporation of non-linear payoffs, such as options or structured swaps, which are difficult to model using static add-ons. Third, it provides a natural platform for integrating collateral and netting effects, which can be incorporated as conditional adjustments at each simulation step. Through these features, the Monte Carlo framework delivers a holistic view of counterparty risk that reflects both market dynamics and contractual risk mitigants (Brigo & Morini, 2010).

Conceptually, the research design aligns with the Internal Model Method (IMM) introduced under Basel II and refined in Basel III. Both approaches rely on forward-looking simulation of potential exposures to estimate regulatory capital requirements for counterparty credit risk. However, the purpose of this study is not regulatory compliance per se, but rather to use a similar modeling structure for analytical insight. By isolating the key components of the IMM—exposure dynamics, default probabilities, and discounting—the model provides a simplified but conceptually faithful representation of how banks assess CVA internally (BCBS, 2011; Mathur & Skoglund, 2013).

In this framework, counterparty credit risk is modeled as a two-dimensional process driven by both market risk and credit risk. Market risk determines the potential exposure (through simulated portfolio values), while credit risk determines the likelihood of counterparty default. The interaction between these two processes gives rise to the expected loss due to counterparty default, which is the essence of CVA. The CVA itself is computed as the discounted expected loss from counterparty default events over the lifetime of the portfolio:

CVA = (1 − R) × ∫<sub>t=0</sub><sup>T</sup> DF(t) × EE(t) × dPD(t),

where *R* is the recovery rate, *DF(t)* is the discount factor at time *t*, *EE(t)* is the expected exposure, and *PD(t)* is the cumulative default probability up to time *t*. This continuous-time expression provides the theoretical foundation for the numerical implementation that follows in subsequent sections.

The research approach is deductive and model-driven, combining established theoretical models with simulation-based numerical techniques. It begins with defining the mathematical representation of credit exposure, followed by model calibration, simulation execution, and sensitivity testing. The analytical focus is not on achieving empirical prediction but on exploring the internal consistency and regulatory implications of exposure modeling. As such, the study emphasizes the structure and logic of the CVA estimation process rather than empirical back-testing against observed market data.

Finally, this chapter also serves to connect the quantitative modeling exercise with the regulatory themes discussed earlier. By implementing a simulation-based exposure model inspired by Basel’s IMM, the analysis bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and regulatory application. The resulting framework allows for a comparative evaluation of how netting and collateral mechanisms—central to the post-crisis regulatory environment—affect counterparty exposure and CVA outcomes. The following sections provide detailed descriptions of the model’s theoretical basis, simulation procedures, and computational implementation.
