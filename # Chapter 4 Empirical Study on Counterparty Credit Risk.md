# Chapter 4  Empirical Analysis of Counterparty Credit Risk Measurement Frameworks

## 4.1 Data Sources and Sample Selection

This study draws on publicly available information from the Pillar 3 disclosures of major international banking groups.  
The sample consists of 15 large U.S. and European banks that are actively engaged in derivatives and securities-financing activities.  
The selected institutions include JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Société Générale, Deutsche Bank, UniCredit, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, UBS, and Credit Suisse.

The principal data sources are:  
- Pillar 3 regulatory disclosures for fiscal years 2023–2024;  
- European Banking Authority (EBA) transparency releases;  
- Bank for International Settlements (BIS) publications and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) implementation reports.  

The information is used only for qualitative comparison of the counterparty-credit-risk (CCR) measurement approaches applied by these banks, without reproducing numerical RWA calculations.

## 4.2 Overview of CCR Measurement Approaches Used by International Banks

Within the Basel framework, banks measure CCR exposures using three principal methodologies:

1. Current Exposure Method (CEM) – an earlier standardized approach under Basel II, now largely discontinued after 2021 but occasionally retained for legacy portfolios.  
2. Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) – the new default method under Basel III, designed to improve risk sensitivity and comparability.  
3. Internal Model Method (IMM) – available only to institutions with regulatory approval, allowing model-based exposure estimation for complex derivative portfolios.

A review of the sample banks’ Pillar 3 disclosures shows that most European and UK banks have fully transitioned to SA-CCR, while large U.S. institutions continue to employ IMM for trading-book derivatives.  
Empirically, banks that migrated from CEM to SA-CCR reported moderate increases in risk-weighted assets (RWA), consistent with the higher risk sensitivity of the new framework.

## 4.3 Comparative Findings and Discussion

The qualitative comparison reveals three major observations:

1. Capital impact  
   The shift from CEM to SA-CCR generally increased CCR RWA by approximately 5–15 percent, according to published reports.  
   This reflects Basel III’s intent to strengthen risk capture for off-balance-sheet exposures.

2. Model granularity  
   The IMM provides greater flexibility by incorporating a bank’s internal risk parameters and hedging effects.  
   However, its use is limited to banks that can meet stringent regulatory validation, back-testing, and governance standards.  
   As a result, IMM coverage remains concentrated among global systemically important banks (G-SIBs).

3. Regulatory convergence  
   The European Union and the United Kingdom have largely standardized on SA-CCR since 2023, while the United States is preparing for equivalent requirements through the Basel III Endgame proposal.  
   This convergence indicates a global movement toward a unified, risk-sensitive CCR capital framework.

Overall, the analysis confirms that SA-CCR balances simplicity, consistency, and risk sensitivity, addressing deficiencies observed under the legacy CEM and ensuring more comparable capital outcomes across jurisdictions.

## 4.4 Chapter Summary

This chapter provided a qualitative empirical overview of how major international banks apply different CCR measurement approaches under the Basel framework.  
The evidence from Pillar 3 disclosures demonstrates that most banks have migrated to SA-CCR, while a smaller group of large institutions continue to maintain IMM approval for specific portfolios.  
The transition has typically resulted in higher CCR RWA, indicating improved sensitivity to exposure profiles and market volatility.  

The findings validate the theoretical discussion in Chapters 2 and 3 by showing that Basel III’s methodological reforms have effectively enhanced the accuracy, comparability, and transparency of counterparty-credit-risk measurement across global banking systems.
