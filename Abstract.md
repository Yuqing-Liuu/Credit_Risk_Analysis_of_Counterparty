# Abstract

The 2008 global financial crisis led to the collapse of numerous large-scale financial institutions involved in derivatives transactions, exposing critical weaknesses in the Basel Committee's framework. This crisis heightened the demand for improved counterparty credit risk (CCR) management among global financial institutions, as such risks directly affect banking system stability and national economic development. Strengthening research in this area holds both significant theoretical and practical importance.

This paper first introduces two fundamental theories of credit risk management: asset management theory and liability management theory. Second, it examines the KMV model, which is based on modern option pricing theory and leverages market information effectively. The study then compares four methods for measuring counterparty credit risk: the Current Exposure Method (CEM), the Internal Model Method (IMM), the Standard Method (SM), and the Non-Internal Model Method (NIMM).
Building on credit risk management theory and the KMV model, this paper conducts a comparative theoretical study of counterparty credit risk measurement approaches. An empirical analysis is subsequently performed using both the KMV and GARCH models. Specifically, the GARCH model is employed to calculate exposure at default (EAD) between counterparties, comprehensively considering firm debt value, debt maturity, and stock volatility. The analysis culminates in computing the theoretical expected probability of default.

Finally, based on the empirical findings, this paper proposes management strategies for counterparty credit risk. These strategies provide reliable credit risk assessment information and actionable policies to help investors, creditors, and regulators identify, mitigate, and eliminate credit risks in a timely manner.
