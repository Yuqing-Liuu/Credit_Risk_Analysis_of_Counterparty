## Modeling CVA Risk

### Introduction
This thesis provides an overview of Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and related concepts within the context of counterparty credit risk. It begins by outlining the historical events that led to the reform of the Basel regulatory framework and the incorporation of CVA as a key component of counterparty risk management.

After establishing the conceptual foundations, the thesis will explore the regulatory treatment of CVA in detail. It introduces the three most widely used methods for calculating the regulatory CVA capital charge, addressing their underlying principles and practical challenges. A particular focus is placed on two methods: the Internal Model Method (IMM) and the Current Exposure Method (CEM). Their differences will be examined both conceptually and mathematically.
