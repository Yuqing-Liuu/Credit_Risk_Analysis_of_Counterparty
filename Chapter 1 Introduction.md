## 1.1 Research Background

### 1.1.1 Research Background

With the rapid expansion of financial derivatives, the world economy has benefited from improved liquidity and diversified financial instruments. However, this growth has also generated significant risks, turning derivatives into a double-edged sword that both promotes and threatens financial stability. During the global financial crisis triggered by the subprime mortgage meltdown in the United States, the excessive proliferation of complex financial derivatives severely impacted the global financial system. Among the various risks exposed, counterparty credit risk (CCR) played a central role, becoming one of the primary factors behind the collapse of major institutions such as Lehman Brothers. The widespread defaults of small and medium-sized financial entities revealed that improper management of CCR could easily amplify systemic risk. Therefore, strengthening the measurement and management of counterparty credit risk became an urgent task for global regulators and market participants.

Although more than a decade has passed since the 2008 financial crisis, its repercussions have not fully subsided. Derivative products linked to subprime and structured assets continue to circulate in financial markets, and the potential accumulation of counterparty credit risk remains a key concern. Effective CCR management not only prevents blind trading and speculative expansion but also contributes to financial-market stability. In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2006) issued the “International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework,” commonly known as Basel II. This accord introduced comprehensive international standards for credit-risk, market-risk, and operational-risk supervision, specifying minimum capital requirements and establishing mechanisms for supervisory review and market discipline.

Following the lessons of the financial crisis, the Basel Committee (2011) released Basel III, which significantly strengthened the capital and liquidity requirements for financial institutions. Compared with Basel II, Basel III incorporated counterparty credit-risk exposures arising from over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities-financing transactions into the capital framework. It also introduced more stringent capital charges for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of regulatory capital to market conditions. These revisions marked a critical improvement in the global regulatory regime for counterparty credit risk.

This study is therefore devoted to a comprehensive examination of counterparty credit risk. It introduces the theoretical underpinnings of credit-risk management, compares existing measurement methodologies, and applies the KMV model to perform empirical evaluation. The objective is to provide a theoretical basis and empirical evidence for improving the management of counterparty credit risk within financial institutions.

### 1.1.2 Research Significance

(1) **Theoretical significance**  
Since the 1990s, the Basel Committee has developed three primary methods for measuring counterparty credit-risk exposure: the Current Exposure Method (CEM), the Standardized Method (SM), and the Internal Model Method (IMM). These models represent successive efforts to enhance the risk sensitivity and comparability of CCR measurement across banks. After the 2008 crisis exposed deficiencies in Basel II, the introduction of CVA risk capital requirements in Basel III addressed market-loss components linked to counterparty exposure (Brigo and Masetti 2005; Brigo and Capponi 2010).  
This research integrates the theoretical framework of credit-risk management with the KMV model and applies them to empirical data to quantify default probability and exposure dynamics. It also reviews key international studies (Duffie 2003; Pykhtin and Zhu 2006; Gibson 2005), providing theoretical insight into the evolution of credit-risk modelling and its regulatory implications.

(2) **Practical significance**  
In the era of financial reform, derivatives and securities-financing transactions are expected to remain essential business lines for commercial banks. While these activities offer new profit opportunities, they also expose institutions to complex counterparty and liquidity risks. In China and other emerging markets, where such products are still in early stages of development, establishing a scientific risk-management framework is crucial. By analysing counterparty exposures from both institutional and market perspectives, and by incorporating international best practices, this study seeks to offer references for small and medium-sized financial institutions.  
Since the Basel Committee (2011) integrated CCR regulation into the international capital framework, the empirical analysis of this research contributes to developing predictive tools and strategic management approaches that enhance the resilience and sustainable growth of financial institutions.

## 1.2 Research Status at Home and Abroad

Counterparty credit risk arises when one contracting party may incur losses due to the default of the other during the life of a financial transaction. Because the exposure is contingent on market factors, CCR links market risk and credit risk in a unique way. As financial innovation deepens, institutions face more counterparties and increasingly complex exposures, which magnifies the likelihood of systemic instability. Therefore, studying counterparty credit-risk management has become essential for maintaining the soundness of the financial system.

### 1.2.1 Research Status

The Internal Model Method for market-risk measurement originates from the Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach first developed by J.P. Morgan in the early 1990s. This methodology employs historical simulation to estimate potential portfolio losses over a specific horizon with a given confidence level (Duffie 2003).  
Duffie (2003) comprehensively described methods for calculating counterparty-risk exposure. Picoult (2002) proposed that multiplying expected exposure by an adjustment factor can reflect concentration risk, while Canabarro, Picoult, and Wilde (2003) suggested that this coefficient typically ranges between 1 and 1.25, compared with the Basel Committee’s official range of 1.2 to 1.4.  

Gibson (2005) demonstrated that margin agreements can reduce more than 80 percent of counterparty exposure and analysed the accuracy of truncated exposure estimators. Dante and Zhu (2005) employed Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate path-dependent derivatives and model counterparty exposure, highlighting the importance of simulation accuracy in CCR estimation.  

Pykhtin and Zhu (2006) summarised a variety of techniques for modelling credit exposure in OTC derivatives and securities-financing transactions. Lu and Juan (2011) argued that precise CVA measurement captures the essential nature of counterparty risk, and that comparing alternative CVA methods yields more robust modelling frameworks.  

Brigo et al. (2011) examined bilateral CVA under collateral re-use, using interest-rate-swap portfolios to illustrate the impact of correlated defaults between counterparties. Alavia et al. (2011) discussed valuation adjustments for derivatives with and without collateral. Following Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, Kamtchueng (2011) noted that credit valuation itself had become a tradable instrument, necessitating more transparent CVA frameworks. Brigo and Capponi (2010) further simplified the calculation of default probabilities for correlated counterparties.  

To strengthen the regulatory framework, the Basel Committee (2011) incorporated CVA risk into the capital rules, requiring both normal and stressed market data in capital calculations. These revisions improved the accuracy of capital requirements and elevated the overall resilience of the banking system.


## 1.3 Research Methods and Ideas

### 1.3.1 Research Methods

This research builds on the Basel Committee’s (2006, 2011) regulatory framework for counterparty credit risk and applies the KMV model to evaluate and mitigate such risk. The main methods adopted include:

1. **Literature analysis** – reviewing key international studies on credit-risk management (Duffie 2003; Brigo and Capponi 2010; Pykhtin and Zhu 2006) to trace theoretical development and modelling evolution;  
2. **Qualitative analysis** – defining the characteristics, mechanisms, and preventive measures of CCR based on Basel regulations and prior research;  
3. **Empirical analysis** – applying the KMV framework to market data, deriving model parameters, and evaluating empirical results to provide policy-relevant conclusions.


## Summary of Chapter 1

This chapter reviewed the research background, theoretical and practical significance, and methodological design of the study. It emphasised the increasing importance of counterparty credit-risk management in modern financial systems and introduced the KMV model as a quantitative tool to assess default probability and exposure. The next chapter presents the theoretical foundation underlying credit-risk management and the KMV modelling framework.
