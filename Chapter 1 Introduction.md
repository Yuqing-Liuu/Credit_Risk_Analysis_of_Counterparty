## 1.1 Research Background and Significance  

### 1.1.1 Research Background  

With the rapid development of financial derivatives, the continuous stability of the world economy has been effectively promoted, but at the same time the financial risks generated have become increasingly obvious, becoming a double-edged sword. During the financial crisis triggered by the U.S. subprime debt problem, the excessive development of financial derivatives caused a severe negative impact in which counterparty credit risk occupied an important position. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in the United States led to the collapse of many small and medium-sized financial institutions, directly showing the risks between financial product counterparties. Strengthening credit-risk management and evaluation became critical to alleviate the damage caused by the economic crisis.  

Although time has passed since the global financial crisis, its impact on the world economy has not completely dissipated. Derivatives transactions based on subprime loans as underlying assets are still growing. Considering counterparty credit-risk management can effectively avoid blind transactions and chaotic investments. In June 2004 the *Basel Committee on Banking Supervision* (2006) promulgated the “Basel II Accord,” which used international standards for credit-risk management and clarified preventive measures for default risk. Subsequently, the *Basel Committee* (2011) issued “Basel III,” which introduced more rigorous requirements for counterparty credit-risk capital and OTC-derivatives supervision. This study analyzes counterparty credit risk, introduces the KMV model measurement method, and empirically examines counterparty credit-risk management measures.

### 1.1.2 Research Significance  

**(1) Theoretical significance.** In 1995 the Basel Committee specified three models for measuring counterparty credit-risk defaults: the current-exposure method (CEM), the standardized method (SM), and the internal-model method (IMM). As the 2008 financial crisis exposed loopholes in Basel II, the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) framework was added to address market-loss capital requirements (*Brigo and Masetti 2005; Brigo and Capponi 2010*). This study combines counterparty-credit-risk measurement models with the KMV approach, performs empirical analysis, and compares findings with international literature (*Duffie 2003; Pykhtin and Zhu 2006; Gibson 2005*), thus providing theoretical value.  

**(2) Practical significance.** Facing ongoing financial reform, derivatives and securities-financing transactions are becoming increasingly important for banks. Considering credit-risk prevention measures and analyzing trading patterns from counterparty and market perspectives can provide reference samples for small and medium-sized enterprises. Since the Basel Committee (2011) incorporated counterparty credit-risk regulation into the international financial framework, it has provided guarantees for credit-risk prediction, investment-transaction management, and sustainable financial-business development. The empirical analysis of this study therefore holds practical significance.

## 1.2 Research Status  

Since one party may suffer losses due to the default of the other party within the contract period, this risk is called counterparty credit risk, closely related to market risk. When financial innovation deepens, institutions face more counterparty risks, increasing crisis probability. Therefore, it is necessary to study counterparty credit risk and re-examine management methods.

### 1.2.1 Research Status  

The internal-model method of market-risk measurement originates from the Value-at-Risk (VaR) model proposed by JP Morgan Bank. Under this approach, historical data are simulated to evaluate potential losses in a portfolio (*Duffie 2003*).  

*Duffie (2003)* comprehensively described counterparty-risk calculation; *Picoult (2002)* proposed multiplying expected exposure by a coefficient to reflect concentration risk; *Canabarro, Picoult and Wilde (2003)* suggested the coefficient varies from 1 to 1.25, while the Basel Committee set it at [1.2, 1.4].  

*Gibson (2005)* indicated that margin systems can reduce more than 80 percent of counterparty-risk exposure and examined truncation-method accuracy. *Dante and Zhu (2005)* simulated path-dependent derivatives to estimate exposure, avoiding valuation bias in Monte Carlo methods.  

*Pykhtin and Zhu (2006)* summarized multiple calculation techniques for OTC derivatives and securities-financing transactions. *Lu and Juan (2011)* emphasized that accurate CVA measurement reveals the essence of counterparty risk, and comparing CVA methods can yield a more efficient framework.  

When collateral is re-pledged, *Brigo et al. (2011)* summarized bilateral CVA methods using interest-rate-swap portfolios and studied correlated default effects. *Alavia et al. (2011)* discussed valuation adjustments for derivatives with and without collateral. After Lehman’s default, *Kamtchueng (2011)* noted the need for clear CVA adjustment methods; *Brigo and Capponi (2010)* proposed simplifying default-probability calculations.  

The Basel Committee (2011) improved regulatory frameworks by incorporating CVA into capital rules and including both normal and stressed market data, raising capital-measurement standards.

## 1.3 Research Methods and Ideas  

### 1.3.1 Research Methods  

This study is based on Basel-Committee (2006, 2011) regulations and applies the KMV model to propose preventive measures.  

1. **Literature analysis** – Review and compare international studies on credit-risk management (*Duffie 2003; Brigo and Capponi 2010; Pykhtin and Zhu 2006*).  
2. **Qualitative analysis** – Define concepts and prevention measures according to Basel standards.  
3. **Empirical analysis** – Use the KMV framework and statistical data to provide reference for credit-risk mitigation.
