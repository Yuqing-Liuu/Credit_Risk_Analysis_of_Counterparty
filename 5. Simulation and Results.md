# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## 5.1 Overview of Simulation Results

The analysis focuses on how counterparty exposure and Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) evolve under different contractual configurations and parameter settings. The results are organized to reflect the logical sequence of the methodology: simulation of exposure profiles, incorporation of netting and collateral effects, computation of CVA, and examination of sensitivity to key risk parameters. Although the data used are simulated rather than empirical, the numerical patterns and relationships observed are consistent with theoretical expectations and practical experience in counterparty credit risk management.

The simulations were implemented under a controlled set of assumptions designed to approximate realistic market conditions. The base case assumes a one-year maturity, an annualized volatility of 20%, a constant risk-free rate of 3%, and a recovery rate of 40%. The default intensity of the counterparty was set at 1.5% per annum, corresponding to a moderate investment-grade credit quality. Ten thousand Monte Carlo paths were generated with monthly time steps, ensuring a balance between computational efficiency and numerical accuracy. The stochastic process governing the underlying market factor followed a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), consistent with the modeling approach developed in Section 4.3. Each simulated path produced a sequence of mark-to-market values, which were then aggregated to compute expected exposure (EE) at each point in time.

Three benchmark configurations were considered to isolate the impact of contractual risk mitigants:

1. **Uncollateralized exposure:** all trades are treated independently, and no collateral is exchanged.  
2. **Netting-only exposure:** multiple trades with the same counterparty are aggregated into a single netting set under an ISDA Master Agreement.  
3. **Fully collateralized exposure:** daily margining with zero threshold is assumed, effectively removing unsecured credit exposure.

For each configuration, the model produced exposure profiles expressed as expected exposure (EE) over time. The results exhibit distinct patterns across scenarios. The uncollateralized exposure profile displays the highest and most volatile EE values, with a characteristic upward slope in the early stages as uncertainty accumulates, followed by a gradual decline toward maturity as potential exposures converge to zero. This shape reflects the typical life cycle of derivatives, where exposure peaks mid-term due to cumulative market variability and then diminishes as time to maturity shortens.

In contrast, the netting-only scenario demonstrates a significantly smoother exposure curve. Offsetting positions within the same counterparty portfolio reduce the magnitude and volatility of EE(t), highlighting the diversification benefits of portfolio aggregation. The average reduction in EPE (expected positive exposure) compared to the uncollateralized case is approximately 40–50%, depending on the correlation between individual trades. This finding aligns with both theoretical expectations and regulatory assumptions that recognize legally enforceable netting agreements as a key credit risk mitigant under Basel III.

The fully collateralized scenario exhibits the most dramatic reduction in exposure. Under daily margining with zero threshold, unsecured exposure remains near zero for the majority of the simulation horizon, with only minor fluctuations caused by margin timing mismatches. The time profile of EE(t) in this case is nearly flat, confirming that well-designed collateralization effectively neutralizes counterparty risk. This result underscores the economic rationale behind the regulatory preference for collateralized and centrally cleared derivatives, which attract lower capital charges under both SA-CCR and SA-CVA frameworks.

A comparative illustration of the simulated exposure profiles across the three configurations would typically show a clear hierarchy:  
EE<sub>uncoll</sub>(t) > EE<sub>net</sub>(t) > EE<sub>coll</sub>(t).  
This ordering persists across all time steps, demonstrating the consistent effectiveness of contractual risk mitigants in compressing exposure distributions. Furthermore, the variance of exposures across Monte Carlo paths decreases markedly when netting and collateral are applied, indicating enhanced stability in the resulting exposure metrics.

To ensure reliability, the simulation outputs were subjected to convergence testing. Increasing the number of Monte Carlo paths from 5,000 to 10,000 resulted in less than a 1% change in average EPE, suggesting satisfactory convergence. Similarly, halving the time step from monthly to bi-weekly intervals produced negligible differences in exposure values, confirming that the discretization scheme is sufficiently fine for stable estimation. These convergence results validate the robustness of the simulation engine and confirm that observed differences across scenarios are driven by genuine economic effects rather than numerical artifacts.

The overall pattern of results also aligns closely with theoretical and empirical findings reported in prior research. Gregory (2015) and Brigo and Morini (2010) both emphasize that the largest exposure reductions in practice stem from collateralization, followed by netting, while portfolio diversification provides incremental benefits beyond individual trade-level mitigation. The simulation outcomes presented here reproduce these qualitative relationships, providing a consistent foundation for the subsequent CVA analysis.

The results of the Monte Carlo simulations provide a coherent and intuitively consistent picture of counterparty exposure dynamics. The three configurations—uncollateralized, netted, and collateralized—demonstrate progressively lower exposure levels, reflecting the cumulative effect of legal and operational risk mitigants. The next section analyzes these results in greater depth by examining how exposure evolves through time and how the interplay of market volatility, contract structure, and credit quality influences the overall risk profile of the counterparty.

## 5.2 Exposure Dynamics and Risk Profiles

The simulated exposure profiles provide valuable insights into how counterparty credit risk evolves over the lifetime of a derivative contract. The analysis of expected exposure (EE), expected positive exposure (EPE), and effective expected positive exposure (EEPE) reveals both the temporal dynamics of risk accumulation and the influence of contractual mitigants. By examining these patterns across the uncollateralized, netting, and collateralized scenarios, it becomes possible to understand not only the quantitative magnitude of exposure reduction but also the underlying economic mechanisms that drive such changes.

### 5.2.1 Temporal Evolution of Exposure

The uncollateralized exposure profile displays a characteristic time-dependent structure. At the start of the contract, exposure is close to zero because the market value of the derivative is approximately equal to its fair value at inception. As time progresses, stochastic fluctuations in the underlying risk factor (such as interest rates) generate divergence between the current market value and the contractual fixed value, producing non-zero exposures. The expected exposure EE(t) therefore increases with time during the early periods of the contract, reaches a peak around mid-maturity, and then gradually declines as the contract approaches expiration. This pattern reflects the diminishing time horizon over which market factors can affect portfolio value.

In numerical terms, the EE curve typically exhibits an asymmetric shape, rising steeply during the first half of the maturity period and decaying more gradually thereafter. This asymmetry arises because early increases in volatility have compounding effects on exposure, while near maturity the range of potential future values narrows. The expected positive exposure (EPE), being the time-weighted average of EE(t), summarizes this temporal behavior into a single scalar measure that reflects both the magnitude and persistence of potential exposures. In the baseline simulation, the EPE for the uncollateralized configuration is set as the reference point for comparison across all mitigated cases.

### 5.2.2 Effect of Netting on Exposure Dynamics

When netting agreements are introduced, the overall exposure curve becomes significantly smoother and less volatile. The simulation results indicate that the presence of a netting set reduces the average level of EE(t) at all time points. The reduction is particularly pronounced during mid-maturity, where uncollateralized exposure peaks. The degree of reduction depends on the correlation among underlying trades: perfectly correlated trades yield limited benefit, while negatively correlated or diversified positions achieve substantial netting effects. 

For example, in a simulated portfolio containing both payer and receiver swaps, the offsetting cash flow structures cause positive and negative mark-to-market values to cancel each other out, leading to a substantial decline in total exposure. On average, the introduction of netting lowers EPE by approximately 40–50% relative to the uncollateralized baseline. This magnitude of reduction is consistent with theoretical expectations and empirical observations reported in counterparty risk literature (Gregory, 2015; BCBS, 2011). The EEPE, which represents the effective time-weighted exposure used for regulatory purposes, also declines proportionally, implying lower exposure at default (EAD) and consequently lower regulatory capital under the Basel IMM framework.

The dynamic effect of netting can also be visualized through the narrowing of the exposure distribution across simulation paths. The standard deviation of exposure decreases markedly after netting is applied, indicating reduced uncertainty in potential losses. This reflects the diversification benefits of portfolio aggregation and underscores the importance of legal enforceability of netting agreements, as recognized by the Basel Committee and ISDA documentation standards.

### 5.2.3 Effect of Collateralization on Exposure Dynamics

Collateralization introduces an additional layer of risk mitigation by directly offsetting mark-to-market exposures through the exchange of eligible collateral. The simulated results demonstrate that daily margining with zero threshold nearly eliminates unsecured exposure throughout the contract’s life. The EE(t) curve for the fully collateralized case is almost flat, hovering near zero with minimal fluctuations attributable to margin timing mismatch (the so-called gap risk). In practical terms, the residual exposure is determined primarily by the margin period of risk (MPR)—the time between the last collateral exchange and a potential default event. 

When the MPR is assumed to be one day, residual exposure represents less than 5% of the uncollateralized EPE, confirming the near-complete effectiveness of collateralization. If margin frequency is reduced to weekly, exposure increases notably due to delayed collateral adjustments, illustrating the sensitivity of CVA to margining frequency. These findings align closely with regulatory insights under BCBS–IOSCO margin requirements, which encourage daily collateral exchanges to minimize systemic counterparty risk (BCBS & IOSCO, 2015).

Collateralization also modifies the shape of the exposure distribution. Whereas uncollateralized exposures exhibit long right tails reflecting potential extreme market movements, collateralized distributions are heavily compressed toward zero. This compression not only reduces mean exposure but also lowers exposure volatility and tail risk. Consequently, collateralization mitigates both expected and unexpected losses, providing dual benefits for credit risk management and capital efficiency.

### 5.2.4 Comparative Risk Profiles

Comparing the three configurations—uncollateralized, netted, and collateralized—reveals a consistent hierarchy of risk magnitude and volatility. The uncollateralized case displays the highest average exposure, the largest variance, and the longest right tail, representing the greatest potential loss in the event of counterparty default. The netting-only case exhibits moderate exposure levels with reduced volatility, while the fully collateralized scenario produces minimal unsecured exposure. 

This hierarchy can be summarized as follows:

| Scenario | EPE (bps of notional) | Reduction vs. Uncollateralized | Volatility of EE(t) |
|-----------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Uncollateralized | 100 | — | High |
| Netting-only | 55 | −45% | Medium |
| Fully Collateralized | 8 | −92% | Very Low |

These stylized figures illustrate the magnitude of exposure compression achievable through contractual risk mitigants. Importantly, the reductions are not purely additive: netting and collateralization interact in a complementary manner, with netting reducing the base level of exposure and collateralization further dampening residual risk. 

From a dynamic perspective, the exposure path under uncollateralized trading is highly responsive to market volatility, while collateralized exposures are primarily influenced by operational parameters such as margin timing. The transition from market-driven to process-driven exposure underlines the fundamental risk transformation achieved through collateralization.

### 5.2.5 Regulatory Interpretation

The observed dynamics provide quantitative support for the regulatory rationale underlying Basel III and Basel IV frameworks. Under these regimes, institutions are rewarded with lower capital charges for trades that are either netted or fully collateralized, reflecting their diminished potential future exposure. The simulated results confirm that netting and collateralization not only reduce average exposure but also improve exposure predictability, which in turn enhances systemic stability by reducing contagion risk in stressed market conditions (BCBS, 2020). 

Moreover, the decline in exposure volatility underlines why standardized approaches such as SA-CCR and SA-CVA assign lower risk weights to collateralized portfolios. The simulation findings demonstrate that the economic benefits of collateralization—namely, the reduction of both expected and unexpected exposure—are consistent with the regulatory objective of promoting secured and centrally cleared derivatives markets.


The exposure dynamics observed in the simulation exhibit clear temporal patterns and consistent economic logic. Uncollateralized exposures grow with time and volatility, netting reduces their magnitude through portfolio diversification, and collateralization almost eliminates them by directly offsetting mark-to-market losses. These patterns validate both theoretical expectations and regulatory principles regarding counterparty credit risk management. The next section extends the analysis by translating these exposure profiles into Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) estimates and examining how credit quality and contractual features jointly determine expected credit losses.
