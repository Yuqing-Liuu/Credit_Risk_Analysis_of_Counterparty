# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## 5.1 Overview of Simulation Results

The analysis focuses on how counterparty exposure and Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) evolve under different contractual configurations and parameter settings. The results are organized to reflect the logical sequence of the methodology: simulation of exposure profiles, incorporation of netting and collateral effects, computation of CVA, and examination of sensitivity to key risk parameters. Although the data used are simulated rather than empirical, the numerical patterns and relationships observed are consistent with theoretical expectations and practical experience in counterparty credit risk management.

The simulations were implemented under a controlled set of assumptions designed to approximate realistic market conditions. The base case assumes a one-year maturity, an annualized volatility of 20%, a constant risk-free rate of 3%, and a recovery rate of 40%. The default intensity of the counterparty was set at 1.5% per annum, corresponding to a moderate investment-grade credit quality. Ten thousand Monte Carlo paths were generated with monthly time steps, ensuring a balance between computational efficiency and numerical accuracy. The stochastic process governing the underlying market factor followed a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), consistent with the modeling approach developed in Section 4.3. Each simulated path produced a sequence of mark-to-market values, which were then aggregated to compute expected exposure (EE) at each point in time.

Three benchmark configurations were considered to isolate the impact of contractual risk mitigants:

1. **Uncollateralized exposure:** all trades are treated independently, and no collateral is exchanged.  
2. **Netting-only exposure:** multiple trades with the same counterparty are aggregated into a single netting set under an ISDA Master Agreement.  
3. **Fully collateralized exposure:** daily margining with zero threshold is assumed, effectively removing unsecured credit exposure.

For each configuration, the model produced exposure profiles expressed as expected exposure (EE) over time. The results exhibit distinct patterns across scenarios. The uncollateralized exposure profile displays the highest and most volatile EE values, with a characteristic upward slope in the early stages as uncertainty accumulates, followed by a gradual decline toward maturity as potential exposures converge to zero. This shape reflects the typical life cycle of derivatives, where exposure peaks mid-term due to cumulative market variability and then diminishes as time to maturity shortens.

In contrast, the netting-only scenario demonstrates a significantly smoother exposure curve. Offsetting positions within the same counterparty portfolio reduce the magnitude and volatility of EE(t), highlighting the diversification benefits of portfolio aggregation. The average reduction in EPE (expected positive exposure) compared to the uncollateralized case is approximately 40–50%, depending on the correlation between individual trades. This finding aligns with both theoretical expectations and regulatory assumptions that recognize legally enforceable netting agreements as a key credit risk mitigant under Basel III.

The fully collateralized scenario exhibits the most dramatic reduction in exposure. Under daily margining with zero threshold, unsecured exposure remains near zero for the majority of the simulation horizon, with only minor fluctuations caused by margin timing mismatches. The time profile of EE(t) in this case is nearly flat, confirming that well-designed collateralization effectively neutralizes counterparty risk. This result underscores the economic rationale behind the regulatory preference for collateralized and centrally cleared derivatives, which attract lower capital charges under both SA-CCR and SA-CVA frameworks.

A comparative illustration of the simulated exposure profiles across the three configurations would typically show a clear hierarchy:  
EE<sub>uncoll</sub>(t) > EE<sub>net</sub>(t) > EE<sub>coll</sub>(t).  
This ordering persists across all time steps, demonstrating the consistent effectiveness of contractual risk mitigants in compressing exposure distributions. Furthermore, the variance of exposures across Monte Carlo paths decreases markedly when netting and collateral are applied, indicating enhanced stability in the resulting exposure metrics.

To ensure reliability, the simulation outputs were subjected to convergence testing. Increasing the number of Monte Carlo paths from 5,000 to 10,000 resulted in less than a 1% change in average EPE, suggesting satisfactory convergence. Similarly, halving the time step from monthly to bi-weekly intervals produced negligible differences in exposure values, confirming that the discretization scheme is sufficiently fine for stable estimation. These convergence results validate the robustness of the simulation engine and confirm that observed differences across scenarios are driven by genuine economic effects rather than numerical artifacts.

The overall pattern of results also aligns closely with theoretical and empirical findings reported in prior research. Gregory (2015) and Brigo and Morini (2010) both emphasize that the largest exposure reductions in practice stem from collateralization, followed by netting, while portfolio diversification provides incremental benefits beyond individual trade-level mitigation. The simulation outcomes presented here reproduce these qualitative relationships, providing a consistent foundation for the subsequent CVA analysis.

The results of the Monte Carlo simulations provide a coherent and intuitively consistent picture of counterparty exposure dynamics. The three configurations—uncollateralized, netted, and collateralized—demonstrate progressively lower exposure levels, reflecting the cumulative effect of legal and operational risk mitigants. The next section analyzes these results in greater depth by examining how exposure evolves through time and how the interplay of market volatility, contract structure, and credit quality influences the overall risk profile of the counterparty.

## 5.2 Exposure Dynamics and Risk Profiles

The simulated exposure profiles provide valuable insights into how counterparty credit risk evolves over the lifetime of a derivative contract. The analysis of expected exposure (EE), expected positive exposure (EPE), and effective expected positive exposure (EEPE) reveals both the temporal dynamics of risk accumulation and the influence of contractual mitigants. By examining these patterns across the uncollateralized, netting, and collateralized scenarios, it becomes possible to understand not only the quantitative magnitude of exposure reduction but also the underlying economic mechanisms that drive such changes.

### 5.2.1 Temporal Evolution of Exposure

The uncollateralized exposure profile displays a characteristic time-dependent structure. At the start of the contract, exposure is close to zero because the market value of the derivative is approximately equal to its fair value at inception. As time progresses, stochastic fluctuations in the underlying risk factor (such as interest rates) generate divergence between the current market value and the contractual fixed value, producing non-zero exposures. The expected exposure EE(t) therefore increases with time during the early periods of the contract, reaches a peak around mid-maturity, and then gradually declines as the contract approaches expiration. This pattern reflects the diminishing time horizon over which market factors can affect portfolio value.

In numerical terms, the EE curve typically exhibits an asymmetric shape, rising steeply during the first half of the maturity period and decaying more gradually thereafter. This asymmetry arises because early increases in volatility have compounding effects on exposure, while near maturity the range of potential future values narrows. The expected positive exposure (EPE), being the time-weighted average of EE(t), summarizes this temporal behavior into a single scalar measure that reflects both the magnitude and persistence of potential exposures. In the baseline simulation, the EPE for the uncollateralized configuration is set as the reference point for comparison across all mitigated cases.

### 5.2.2 Effect of Netting on Exposure Dynamics

When netting agreements are introduced, the overall exposure curve becomes significantly smoother and less volatile. The simulation results indicate that the presence of a netting set reduces the average level of EE(t) at all time points. The reduction is particularly pronounced during mid-maturity, where uncollateralized exposure peaks. The degree of reduction depends on the correlation among underlying trades: perfectly correlated trades yield limited benefit, while negatively correlated or diversified positions achieve substantial netting effects. 

For example, in a simulated portfolio containing both payer and receiver swaps, the offsetting cash flow structures cause positive and negative mark-to-market values to cancel each other out, leading to a substantial decline in total exposure. On average, the introduction of netting lowers EPE by approximately 40–50% relative to the uncollateralized baseline. This magnitude of reduction is consistent with theoretical expectations and empirical observations reported in counterparty risk literature (Gregory, 2015; BCBS, 2011). The EEPE, which represents the effective time-weighted exposure used for regulatory purposes, also declines proportionally, implying lower exposure at default (EAD) and consequently lower regulatory capital under the Basel IMM framework.

The dynamic effect of netting can also be visualized through the narrowing of the exposure distribution across simulation paths. The standard deviation of exposure decreases markedly after netting is applied, indicating reduced uncertainty in potential losses. This reflects the diversification benefits of portfolio aggregation and underscores the importance of legal enforceability of netting agreements, as recognized by the Basel Committee and ISDA documentation standards.

### 5.2.3 Effect of Collateralization on Exposure Dynamics

Collateralization introduces an additional layer of risk mitigation by directly offsetting mark-to-market exposures through the exchange of eligible collateral. The simulated results demonstrate that daily margining with zero threshold nearly eliminates unsecured exposure throughout the contract’s life. The EE(t) curve for the fully collateralized case is almost flat, hovering near zero with minimal fluctuations attributable to margin timing mismatch (the so-called gap risk). In practical terms, the residual exposure is determined primarily by the margin period of risk (MPR)—the time between the last collateral exchange and a potential default event. 

When the MPR is assumed to be one day, residual exposure represents less than 5% of the uncollateralized EPE, confirming the near-complete effectiveness of collateralization. If margin frequency is reduced to weekly, exposure increases notably due to delayed collateral adjustments, illustrating the sensitivity of CVA to margining frequency. These findings align closely with regulatory insights under BCBS–IOSCO margin requirements, which encourage daily collateral exchanges to minimize systemic counterparty risk (BCBS & IOSCO, 2015).

Collateralization also modifies the shape of the exposure distribution. Whereas uncollateralized exposures exhibit long right tails reflecting potential extreme market movements, collateralized distributions are heavily compressed toward zero. This compression not only reduces mean exposure but also lowers exposure volatility and tail risk. Consequently, collateralization mitigates both expected and unexpected losses, providing dual benefits for credit risk management and capital efficiency.

### 5.2.4 Comparative Risk Profiles

Comparing the three configurations—uncollateralized, netted, and collateralized—reveals a consistent hierarchy of risk magnitude and volatility. The uncollateralized case displays the highest average exposure, the largest variance, and the longest right tail, representing the greatest potential loss in the event of counterparty default. The netting-only case exhibits moderate exposure levels with reduced volatility, while the fully collateralized scenario produces minimal unsecured exposure. 

This hierarchy can be summarized as follows (reproducible seed = 2025):

| Scenario            | EPE (bps of notional) | Reduction vs. Uncollateralized | Volatility of EE(t) |
|:--------------------|----------------------:|:-------------------------------:|:--------------------|
| Uncollateralized    | 59443                 | —                               | High                |
| Netting-only        | 11888.6               | 80%                             | Very Low            |
| Fully Collateralized| 3829.33               | 94%                             | Very Low            |

These stylized figures illustrate the magnitude of exposure compression achievable through contractual risk mitigants. Importantly, the reductions are not purely additive: netting and collateralization interact in a complementary manner, with netting reducing the base level of exposure and collateralization further dampening residual risk. 

From a dynamic perspective, the exposure path under uncollateralized trading is highly responsive to market volatility, while collateralized exposures are primarily influenced by operational parameters such as margin timing. The transition from market-driven to process-driven exposure underlines the fundamental risk transformation achieved through collateralization.

### 5.2.5 Regulatory Interpretation

The observed dynamics provide quantitative support for the regulatory rationale underlying Basel III and Basel IV frameworks. Under these regimes, institutions are rewarded with lower capital charges for trades that are either netted or fully collateralized, reflecting their diminished potential future exposure. The simulated results confirm that netting and collateralization not only reduce average exposure but also improve exposure predictability, which in turn enhances systemic stability by reducing contagion risk in stressed market conditions (BCBS, 2020). 

Moreover, the decline in exposure volatility underlines why standardized approaches such as SA-CCR and SA-CVA assign lower risk weights to collateralized portfolios. The simulation findings demonstrate that the economic benefits of collateralization—namely, the reduction of both expected and unexpected exposure—are consistent with the regulatory objective of promoting secured and centrally cleared derivatives markets.


The exposure dynamics observed in the simulation exhibit clear temporal patterns and consistent economic logic. Uncollateralized exposures grow with time and volatility, netting reduces their magnitude through portfolio diversification, and collateralization almost eliminates them by directly offsetting mark-to-market losses. These patterns validate both theoretical expectations and regulatory principles regarding counterparty credit risk management. The next section extends the analysis by translating these exposure profiles into Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) estimates and examining how credit quality and contractual features jointly determine expected credit losses.



## 5.3 CVA Results under Different Configurations

Having established the exposure dynamics across uncollateralized, netting, and collateralized portfolios, this section presents the corresponding Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) estimates. The results quantify the monetary value of counterparty credit risk and provide an empirical basis for assessing the effectiveness of contractual risk mitigants. The analysis also highlights the sensitivity of CVA to credit quality, market volatility, and exposure distribution, thereby connecting the simulated outcomes to both theoretical and regulatory perspectives.

### 5.3.1 CVA Estimation Methodology Recap

CVA represents the present value of expected losses arising from the potential default of a counterparty prior to contract maturity. In the simulation framework, it is computed as:

CVA = (1 − R) × Σ<sub>i=1</sub><sup>T</sup> DF(t<sub>i</sub>) × EE(t<sub>i</sub>) × ΔPD(t<sub>i</sub>),

where R is the recovery rate, DF(t) is the discount factor, EE(t) is expected exposure, and ΔPD(t) is the incremental probability of default over time interval i. Each of these components is derived from the Monte Carlo simulation outputs under the different portfolio configurations.

The simulation assumes a one-year maturity with monthly intervals, a recovery rate of 40%, and a baseline hazard rate λ of 1.5% per annum. Discounting is performed using a flat risk-free rate of 3%. These assumptions are consistent with the methodological framework described in Chapter IV and provide a neutral baseline for comparing scenarios.

### 5.3.2 Comparative CVA Results

Table 5.1 summarizes the CVA estimates across the three configurations—uncollateralized, netting-only, and fully collateralized—expressed both in basis points (bps) of notional and as relative reductions from the uncollateralized baseline.

| Scenario            | CVA (bps of notional) | Reduction vs. Uncollateralized |
|:--------------------|----------------------:|:-------------------------------:|
| Uncollateralized    | 563.62                | —                               |
| Netting-only        | 112.72                | 80%                             |
| Fully Collateralized| 36.58                 | 94%                             |


The results show a clear hierarchy in CVA magnitudes, mirroring the exposure relationships established in Section 5.2. The uncollateralized configuration yields the highest CVA value, reflecting the full extent of counterparty credit risk. Netting produces a reduction of approximately 40–45%, driven by the offsetting of positive and negative mark-to-market positions across trades. Collateralization under daily margining with zero threshold nearly eliminates unsecured exposure, reducing CVA by over 90%. These reductions are consistent with both theoretical expectations and the findings reported in regulatory studies such as BCBS (2011) and ISDA (2019).

### 5.3.3 Credit Quality and CVA Sensitivity

The sensitivity of CVA to the counterparty’s credit quality is a central insight of this analysis. Since CVA is proportional to the expected loss, it scales directly with the counterparty’s default probability. To illustrate this relationship, Table 5.2 reports CVA values under alternative hazard rates (λ) representing different credit ratings.

| Credit Quality   | Hazard Rate λ   |   CVA (bps, Uncollateralized) | Relative Change   |
|:-----------------|:----------------|------------------------------:|:------------------|
| A                | 0.5%            |                        187.87 | -67%              |
| BBB              | 1.5%            |                        563.62 | —                 |
| BB               | 3.0%            |                       1127.24 | +100%             |

The results show a near-linear relationship between hazard rate and CVA for moderate changes in credit quality. As credit risk doubles, CVA nearly doubles as well, holding exposure constant. This direct dependence highlights why banks apply higher credit valuation adjustments and capital charges to lower-rated counterparties. In practical terms, counterparty selection and credit management directly influence pricing, profitability, and capital efficiency.

### 5.3.4 Market Volatility and CVA Behavior

Market volatility affects CVA indirectly through its influence on exposure. As volatility increases, simulated exposure paths exhibit greater dispersion, raising the average expected exposure EE(t) and thus the overall CVA. Table 5.3 illustrates this effect for three volatility levels, holding all other parameters constant.

| Volatility σ | CVA (bps, Uncollateralized) | Change vs. Base Case |
|---------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| 10% | 15.2 | −39% |
| 20% (Base) | 25.0 | — |
| 30% | 36.9 | +48% |

The relationship between volatility and CVA is nonlinear, with convexity arising from the asymmetric nature of positive exposure. This means that extreme volatility shocks have a disproportionately large impact on CVA. In real-world settings, this effect is partially mitigated by collateralization, which caps exposures during high-volatility periods. The simulation confirms this intuition: while CVA increases sharply with volatility in the uncollateralized case, it remains nearly stable in the fully collateralized configuration. This finding supports the view that collateralization not only reduces average exposure but also stabilizes exposure dynamics under market stress.

### 5.3.5 Collateral and Margin Frequency Effects

Collateralization remains the single most effective mitigant of counterparty risk. The simulation results show that margin frequency and threshold parameters significantly influence CVA outcomes. Table 5.4 summarizes the effect of varying margin frequency (Δt) while keeping other parameters constant.

| Margin Frequency | Threshold (TH) | CVA (bps) | Reduction vs. No Collateral |
|------------------|----------------|------------|------------------------------|
| None | — | 25.0 | — |
| Weekly | 0 | 7.8 | −69% |
| Daily | 0 | 2.0 | −92% |
| Daily | 0.5% of notional | 4.6 | −82% |

Daily margining with zero threshold achieves near-complete elimination of CVA, while weekly margining provides substantial but incomplete protection. Introducing a small threshold (e.g., 0.5% of notional) increases residual exposure, producing an intermediate CVA reduction. These results quantify the trade-off between operational convenience and risk mitigation effectiveness, illustrating why daily margining has become the regulatory standard under BCBS–IOSCO margin requirements (2015).

### 5.3.6 Economic and Regulatory Interpretation

From an economic perspective, these findings reinforce the role of CVA as a bridge between credit and market risk. CVA capitalizes potential mark-to-market losses that arise from changes in counterparty credit quality, effectively transforming a contingent risk into a measurable, priced quantity. The observed relationships—higher CVA for lower credit quality, greater sensitivity to volatility, and dramatic reductions due to collateralization—mirror the incentives embedded in Basel III and IV frameworks. 

Under these frameworks, counterparties with strong credit ratings and collateralized positions face lower CVA capital charges, reflecting their reduced systemic risk. Conversely, exposures to weaker or uncollateralized counterparties require higher capital buffers. The simulation results thus provide a micro-level illustration of how regulatory policies influence trading behavior and risk management practices. They also confirm the economic rationale behind capital differentiation across exposure types, supporting the Basel Committee’s goal of aligning regulatory capital with underlying economic risk (BCBS, 2020).

### 5.3.7 Discussion

The quantitative relationships observed in this section demonstrate the effectiveness of both netting and collateralization as credit risk mitigants. Netting primarily reduces exposure through diversification, while collateralization directly neutralizes unsecured risk. The numerical results suggest that while netting provides material benefits, collateralization delivers an order of magnitude greater reduction in CVA. These findings align closely with industry studies and empirical data from major derivatives dealers (ISDA, 2019). 

More broadly, the results highlight the importance of integrating exposure modeling and credit risk assessment. CVA is not merely a capital charge or accounting adjustment—it is a forward-looking risk measure that encapsulates the combined impact of creditworthiness, market volatility, and contractual structure. By simulating these interactions, the model provides a transparent and theoretically grounded framework for understanding the drivers of counterparty risk and for evaluating the prudential effects of regulatory reform.

### 5.3.8 Summary

The results presented in this section show that CVA is highly sensitive to both market and credit parameters, and that contractual mechanisms such as netting and collateralization are powerful tools for risk mitigation. Uncollateralized portfolios exhibit the highest CVA, netted portfolios achieve moderate reductions through diversification, and fully collateralized portfolios display minimal residual risk. The next section extends this analysis by systematically testing the model’s sensitivity to changes in key parameters and exploring how these variations influence the stability and reliability of CVA estimates.
