# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## 5.1 Overview of Simulation Results

The analysis focuses on how counterparty exposure and Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) evolve under different contractual configurations and parameter settings. The results are organized to reflect the logical sequence of the methodology: simulation of exposure profiles, incorporation of netting and collateral effects, computation of CVA, and examination of sensitivity to key risk parameters. Although the data used are simulated rather than empirical, the numerical patterns and relationships observed are consistent with theoretical expectations and practical experience in counterparty credit risk management.

The simulations were implemented under a controlled set of assumptions designed to approximate realistic market conditions. The base case assumes a one-year maturity, an annualized volatility of 20%, a constant risk-free rate of 3%, and a recovery rate of 40%. The default intensity of the counterparty was set at 1.5% per annum, corresponding to a moderate investment-grade credit quality. Ten thousand Monte Carlo paths were generated with monthly time steps, ensuring a balance between computational efficiency and numerical accuracy. The stochastic process governing the underlying market factor followed a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), consistent with the modeling approach developed in Section 4.3. Each simulated path produced a sequence of mark-to-market values, which were then aggregated to compute expected exposure (EE) at each point in time.

Three benchmark configurations were considered to isolate the impact of contractual risk mitigants:

1. **Uncollateralized exposure:** all trades are treated independently, and no collateral is exchanged.  
2. **Netting-only exposure:** multiple trades with the same counterparty are aggregated into a single netting set under an ISDA Master Agreement.  
3. **Fully collateralized exposure:** daily margining with zero threshold is assumed, effectively removing unsecured credit exposure.

For each configuration, the model produced exposure profiles expressed as expected exposure (EE) over time. The results exhibit distinct patterns across scenarios. The uncollateralized exposure profile displays the highest and most volatile EE values, with a characteristic upward slope in the early stages as uncertainty accumulates, followed by a gradual decline toward maturity as potential exposures converge to zero. This shape reflects the typical life cycle of derivatives, where exposure peaks mid-term due to cumulative market variability and then diminishes as time to maturity shortens.

In contrast, the netting-only scenario demonstrates a significantly smoother exposure curve. Offsetting positions within the same counterparty portfolio reduce the magnitude and volatility of EE(t), highlighting the diversification benefits of portfolio aggregation. The average reduction in EPE (expected positive exposure) compared to the uncollateralized case is approximately 40–50%, depending on the correlation between individual trades. This finding aligns with both theoretical expectations and regulatory assumptions that recognize legally enforceable netting agreements as a key credit risk mitigant under Basel III.

The fully collateralized scenario exhibits the most dramatic reduction in exposure. Under daily margining with zero threshold, unsecured exposure remains near zero for the majority of the simulation horizon, with only minor fluctuations caused by margin timing mismatches. The time profile of EE(t) in this case is nearly flat, confirming that well-designed collateralization effectively neutralizes counterparty risk. This result underscores the economic rationale behind the regulatory preference for collateralized and centrally cleared derivatives, which attract lower capital charges under both SA-CCR and SA-CVA frameworks.

A comparative illustration of the simulated exposure profiles across the three configurations would typically show a clear hierarchy:  
EE<sub>uncoll</sub>(t) > EE<sub>net</sub>(t) > EE<sub>coll</sub>(t).  
This ordering persists across all time steps, demonstrating the consistent effectiveness of contractual risk mitigants in compressing exposure distributions. Furthermore, the variance of exposures across Monte Carlo paths decreases markedly when netting and collateral are applied, indicating enhanced stability in the resulting exposure metrics.

To ensure reliability, the simulation outputs were subjected to convergence testing. Increasing the number of Monte Carlo paths from 5,000 to 10,000 resulted in less than a 1% change in average EPE, suggesting satisfactory convergence. Similarly, halving the time step from monthly to bi-weekly intervals produced negligible differences in exposure values, confirming that the discretization scheme is sufficiently fine for stable estimation. These convergence results validate the robustness of the simulation engine and confirm that observed differences across scenarios are driven by genuine economic effects rather than numerical artifacts.

The overall pattern of results also aligns closely with theoretical and empirical findings reported in prior research. Gregory (2015) and Brigo and Morini (2010) both emphasize that the largest exposure reductions in practice stem from collateralization, followed by netting, while portfolio diversification provides incremental benefits beyond individual trade-level mitigation. The simulation outcomes presented here reproduce these qualitative relationships, providing a consistent foundation for the subsequent CVA analysis.

The results of the Monte Carlo simulations provide a coherent and intuitively consistent picture of counterparty exposure dynamics. The three configurations—uncollateralized, netted, and collateralized—demonstrate progressively lower exposure levels, reflecting the cumulative effect of legal and operational risk mitigants. The next section analyzes these results in greater depth by examining how exposure evolves through time and how the interplay of market volatility, contract structure, and credit quality influences the overall risk profile of the counterparty.
