# Chapter 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Motivation

Over the past two decades, the rapid expansion of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets has fundamentally changed the way financial institutions manage risk. Derivatives have become indispensable instruments for hedging, speculation, and liquidity management, but their interconnected nature has also introduced new channels of systemic vulnerability. One of the most critical dimensions of this vulnerability is counterparty credit risk (CCR)—the risk that a counterparty to a financial transaction fails to meet its contractual obligations before or at maturity.

The global financial crisis of 2008 revealed that existing credit risk frameworks failed to capture the true nature of these exposures. When Lehman Brothers collapsed and AIG approached insolvency, many institutions experienced severe losses not because of actual defaults, but because of the sharp deterioration in counterparties’ credit spreads. This market-driven component of credit risk was not accounted for in the pre-crisis regulatory capital rules, which focused narrowly on default probabilities. As a result, derivative portfolios that appeared sound from a default-risk perspective suffered significant mark-to-market losses when counterparties’ perceived credit quality declined.

In response to these weaknesses, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) introduced several reforms aimed at strengthening the resilience of the global banking system. Basel III, published in 2010, placed greater emphasis on the integration of credit and market risk into a unified framework. One of its most significant innovations was the inclusion of the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) capital charge—a measure that explicitly accounts for changes in the fair value of derivative positions due to fluctuations in counterparties’ credit spreads. CVA thus represents the market value of counterparty credit risk and forms a bridge between traditional credit risk management and market risk measurement.

Understanding and modeling CVA accurately has since become a central concern for both regulators and practitioners. It affects pricing, profitability, and capital allocation, and serves as a key link between economic risk measurement and regulatory compliance. However, despite progress in regulatory modeling frameworks, estimating CVA remains a complex task that involves significant model uncertainty and computational intensity.

## 1.2 Research Problem and Objectives

Although CVA is now well established as part of the Basel capital framework, the practical estimation of counterparty exposure remains challenging. Regulatory methods such as the Current Exposure Method (CEM) and the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) provide transparency and comparability, but they often overstate exposure because they rely on fixed add-on factors that ignore key portfolio effects. These simplified methods do not capture the benefits of netting and collateralization, nor do they recognize the dynamic interaction between market volatility and credit exposure.

On the other hand, the Internal Model Method (IMM) allows financial institutions to estimate exposure using Monte Carlo simulation. This approach provides a risk-sensitive framework that captures nonlinear portfolio behavior and incorporates contractual mitigants such as netting sets and collateral agreements. However, the IMM is computationally demanding and data intensive, and its implementation requires supervisory approval. As a result, many institutions rely on hybrid approaches or simplified approximations, creating a persistent gap between economic exposure and regulatory measures.

This thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of this gap by developing and applying a Monte Carlo simulation framework that quantifies how key market and contractual parameters influence CVA. The study focuses on three primary drivers:
1. **Credit quality**, represented by the counterparty’s hazard rate (λ);
2. **Market volatility**, which affects the dispersion of potential exposures;
3. **Collateralization**, characterized by margin frequency and threshold levels.

By systematically varying these parameters, the simulation framework quantifies how CVA responds to changes in credit quality, market conditions, and collateral practices. The results provide a quantitative perspective on the economic logic underlying regulatory capital requirements and offer insights into how risk mitigation mechanisms can effectively reduce counterparty exposure.

The purpose of this thesis is therefore to model and quantify how market and contractual parameters drive changes in Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA). Using a simulation-based approach, the study highlights the practical implications of credit quality, volatility, and collateral frequency for managing counterparty credit risk under Basel III.

## 1.3 Methodological Overview

The analytical framework employed in this thesis is based on a Monte Carlo simulation of future market states using a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) process for the underlying asset. The model generates time-dependent distributions of mark-to-market values, from which expected exposure (EE), expected positive exposure (EPE), and effective expected positive exposure (EEPE) are derived. These measures are then used to compute the CVA according to the standard discounted expected loss formula:

$$
CVA = (1 - R) \int_0^T DF(t) \, EE(t) \, dPD(t),
$$

where \(DF(t)\) is the risk-free discount factor, \(R\) is the recovery rate, and \(PD(t)\) is the cumulative default probability implied by the hazard rate λ.  

The simulation is designed to capture the impact of both market dynamics (through volatility σ) and contractual mitigants (through netting and collateralization). Different configurations—uncollateralized, netted, and collateralized—are analyzed to demonstrate how exposure evolves under realistic contractual arrangements. The results are benchmarked across varying credit qualities and volatility regimes to provide a comprehensive view of CVA sensitivity.

## 1.4 Expected Contribution

While the underlying modeling techniques are well established, this thesis provides a systematic quantitative analysis that connects theoretical modeling with practical regulatory implications. The main contributions can be summarized as follows:

1. **Model Integration:** A unified Monte Carlo simulation framework is developed to link exposure modeling, CVA computation, and regulatory interpretation within a single structure.
2. **Sensitivity Analysis:** The thesis quantifies how credit quality, volatility, and collateralization jointly affect CVA magnitude and stability.
3. **Regulatory Perspective:** The results are interpreted through the lens of Basel III, illustrating how modeling assumptions and contractual mitigants influence capital adequacy.
4. **Practical Insight:** The study demonstrates the relative effectiveness of netting and collateral practices in mitigating CVA and supports the regulatory rationale for daily margining and risk-sensitive capital requirements.

Rather than proposing a new valuation model, this thesis focuses on clarifying how existing modeling principles can be applied to produce economically meaningful and regulatory-relevant insights.
