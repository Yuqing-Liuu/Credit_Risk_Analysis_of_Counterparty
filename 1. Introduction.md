# Chapter 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Motivation

Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives have become an essential part of modern financial markets, allowing institutions to hedge, speculate, and manage balance sheet risk more efficiently. However, these contracts also create a web of bilateral exposures that link the financial system together. When one party fails to meet its contractual obligations, the resulting counterparty credit risk (CCR) can trigger losses that spread across markets.

The global financial crisis of 2008 exposed how fragile this interconnected structure was. The collapse of Lehman Brothers and the near-default of AIG revealed that banks could suffer large mark-to-market losses even without an actual default, simply because counterparties’ credit spreads widened. Pre-crisis capital rules did not capture this market-driven component of credit risk—known today as **Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)**. As a result, financial institutions carried insufficient capital buffers against losses arising from changes in counterparties’ creditworthiness.

In response, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) launched a series of reforms—Basel II and Basel III—that transformed the regulatory treatment of counterparty risk. Basel III, in particular, introduced a **CVA capital charge** to capture potential losses from credit spread volatility. This shift acknowledged that counterparty risk is not purely a binary default event but also a market-sensitive valuation effect. Since then, the accurate modeling of CVA has become a core part of risk management and capital planning for banks.

Despite regulatory advances, the practical estimation of CVA remains challenging. Exposure profiles depend on both stochastic market movements and contractual risk mitigants such as netting and collateralization. Standardized regulatory approaches (CEM, SA-CCR) use fixed conversion factors that simplify implementation but often overestimate exposure. In contrast, internal model approaches (IMM) offer greater accuracy but require complex simulations and supervisory approval. Bridging this gap between theoretical precision and regulatory practicality remains an ongoing issue in financial risk management.

## 1.2 Research Purpose and Objectives

The purpose of this thesis is to use a Monte Carlo simulation framework to quantify how three key factors—**credit quality, market volatility, and collateralization**—affect counterparty exposure and Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA). By systematically varying these parameters, the study aims to demonstrate how each driver influences the magnitude of CVA and how their combined effects align with the logic of the Basel III framework.

In simpler terms, the goal is to answer three practical questions:
1. How does a counterparty’s credit quality (hazard rate) impact CVA in magnitude and sensitivity?  
2. How does market volatility influence the shape and convexity of exposure distributions?  
3. How do margining frequency and collateral thresholds reduce exposure and overall CVA?

These questions are addressed through a unified simulation model that generates exposure profiles under different scenarios. The results are then compared to theoretical expectations and interpreted in light of regulatory capital requirements.

## 1.3 Methodological Overview

The analytical framework builds on a Monte Carlo simulation of future market states, assuming that the underlying risk factor follows a geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For each simulated path, the derivative’s mark-to-market value is computed, and the **expected exposure (EE)**, **expected positive exposure (EPE)**, and **effective expected positive exposure (EEPE)** are derived. These quantities form the foundation for estimating CVA according to the discounted expected loss formula:

$$
CVA = (1 - R) \int_0^T DF(t) \, EE(t) \, dPD(t),
$$

where \(DF(t)\) is the risk-free discount factor, \(R\) is the recovery rate, and \(PD(t)\) is the cumulative default probability implied by the counterparty’s hazard rate λ.

The model is implemented in Python and designed to reproduce realistic exposure behavior across different risk conditions. Scenarios include:
- **Credit quality variation**, by adjusting λ between investment-grade and speculative-grade levels;
- **Market volatility variation**, by changing the standard deviation (σ) of the GBM process;
- **Collateralization scenarios**, comparing uncollateralized, weekly margined, and daily margined cases with and without thresholds.

This approach does not seek to develop a new valuation model but rather to test and visualize how established CVA principles behave under controlled and replicable simulation settings.

## 1.4 Contribution and Relevance

The contribution of this thesis is practical rather than theoretical. It demonstrates, using transparent simulations, how key modeling and contractual parameters jointly determine the size and stability of CVA. The results confirm several widely cited relationships:

- CVA scales almost linearly with the counterparty’s hazard rate (λ), confirming that weaker credit quality directly amplifies expected loss.  
- Increases in market volatility (σ) widen exposure distributions and make CVA grow nonlinearly, illustrating the convex relationship between volatility and credit exposure.  
- Collateralization—especially daily margining with low thresholds—reduces CVA by up to 40%, supporting the regulatory emphasis on margining as a systemic risk mitigant.

From a regulatory perspective, these findings reinforce the rationale of Basel III’s CVA capital charge and the BCBS–IOSCO margin requirements. From a modeling perspective, they highlight how a simple, transparent Monte Carlo setup can reproduce complex exposure behaviors in a way that bridges economic intuition and regulatory logic.

In short, the thesis contributes by turning theoretical risk principles into quantifiable, interpretable results that can inform both risk modeling and policy understanding.

## 1.5 Structure of the Thesis

The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows:

- **Chapter 2** reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on counterparty credit risk and valuation adjustments, tracing the evolution of CVA as both a pricing and regulatory concept.  
- **Chapter 3** outlines the Basel I–III regulatory frameworks, emphasizing the introduction of CVA capital treatment and its connection to model-based exposure estimation.  
- **Chapter 4** presents the simulation methodology, including the model setup, parameter selection, and computational procedure.  
- **Chapter 5** reports and discusses the simulation results, focusing on exposure dynamics, CVA sensitivity, and the quantitative impact of collateralization.  
- **Chapter 6** concludes the thesis with key findings, regulatory implications, and directions for future research.

Through this structure, the thesis moves from regulatory motivation to modeling implementation and finally to simulation-based interpretation, providing both conceptual understanding and practical evidence on the determinants of Credit Valuation Adjustment.
