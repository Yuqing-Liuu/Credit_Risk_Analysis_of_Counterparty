## 1.1 Background and Motivation

Over-the-counter derivatives allow institutions to transfer and manage risk but create bilateral counterparty exposures across the system. During the 2008 crisis, many firms suffered large mark-to-market losses as counterparties’ credit spreads widened, even without immediate defaults, exposing a gap in pre-crisis capital rules that focused on default-only measures (BCBS, 2011; Gregory, 2015). Basel III introduced the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) capital charge to recognize that counterparty risk includes a market-sensitive valuation component linked to credit spreads (BCBS, 2011, 2015). Accurate CVA modeling now affects pricing, profitability, and regulatory capital, yet remains challenging because exposures depend jointly on market dynamics and contractual mitigants such as netting and collateralization (Brigo and Morini, 2010; Gregory, 2015).

## 1.2 Research Purpose and Objectives

The purpose of this thesis is to use a Monte Carlo simulation framework to quantify how credit quality, market volatility, and collateralization affect counterparty exposure and CVA under Basel-consistent assumptions. Three practical questions guide the analysis:

1. How does the counterparty hazard rate influence the level and sensitivity of CVA?

2. How does market volatility shape exposure distributions and CVA convexity?

3. How do margining frequency and collateral thresholds reduce exposure and CVA?

The framework varies these drivers systematically and interprets the results against regulatory logic in Basel III and related margin requirements (BCBS, 2011, 2015; BCBS and IOSCO, 2015).

## 1.3 Methodological Overview

The analytical framework builds on a Monte Carlo simulation of future market states, assuming that the underlying risk factor follows a geometric Brownian motion (GBM). For each simulated path, the derivative’s mark-to-market value is computed, and the **expected exposure (EE)**, **expected positive exposure (EPE)**, and **effective expected positive exposure (EEPE)** are derived. These quantities form the foundation for estimating CVA according to the discounted expected loss formula:

$$
CVA = (1 - R) \int_0^T DF(t) \, EE(t) \, dPD(t),
$$

where \(DF(t)\) is the risk-free discount factor, \(R\) is the recovery rate, and \(PD(t)\) is the cumulative default probability implied by the counterparty’s hazard rate λ.

The model is implemented in Python and designed to reproduce realistic exposure behavior across different risk conditions. Scenarios include:
- **Credit quality variation**, by adjusting λ between investment-grade and speculative-grade levels;
- **Market volatility variation**, by changing the standard deviation (σ) of the GBM process;
- **Collateralization scenarios**, comparing uncollateralized, weekly margined, and daily margined cases with and without thresholds.

This approach does not seek to develop a new valuation model but rather to test and visualize how established CVA principles behave under controlled and replicable simulation settings.
