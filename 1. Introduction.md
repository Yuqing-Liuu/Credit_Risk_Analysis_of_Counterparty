# I. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Background and Motivation

Over the past decades, the global financial system has become increasingly complex, with the rapid expansion of derivative markets transforming the way financial institutions manage risk. Derivatives have become essential tools for hedging and trading, yet their extensive use has also introduced new channels of interconnectedness and vulnerability. One of the most significant risks arising from this interconnected structure is counterparty credit risk (CCR), defined as the possibility that a counterparty to a financial transaction fails to meet its contractual obligations before or at maturity.

The global financial crisis of 2008 revealed that many financial institutions underestimated and inadequately managed counterparty exposures. The failure of large investment banks such as Lehman Brothers and the near-collapse of AIG demonstrated that credit risk could materialize not only through defaults but also through severe deterioration in counterparties’ credit quality. Losses related to mark-to-market declines in counterparty creditworthiness often exceeded those from direct defaults. This experience exposed a fundamental weakness in pre-crisis risk management practices, where the focus was predominantly on default events rather than on the valuation effects of changing credit spreads.

In response to these shortcomings, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) introduced a comprehensive series of regulatory reforms to strengthen the resilience of the international banking system. Basel III, published in 2010, placed greater emphasis on the integration of credit and market risk into a unified framework. Among its most significant innovations was the introduction of the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) as a distinct component of counterparty credit risk measurement. CVA represents the change in the fair value of a derivative portfolio due to the expected losses resulting from a counterparty’s possible default prior to maturity. It measures the market value of counterparty credit risk and links the concept of credit risk directly to derivative pricing and capital adequacy.

By introducing CVA as a separate capital charge, Basel III acknowledged that counterparty risk extends beyond the probability of default and includes the sensitivity of portfolio valuations to movements in credit spreads. This marked a conceptual shift in risk regulation—from viewing credit losses as binary events to recognizing them as dynamic processes influenced by market factors. CVA thus became a bridge between market and credit risk, influencing both pricing and capital management. Accurately modeling CVA is now an integral part of risk management practices for banks and other financial institutions, as it affects both profitability and regulatory compliance.

## 1.2 Research Problem and Objectives

Despite significant progress in regulatory reform, the accurate estimation of counterparty credit exposure remains a challenging task. Standardized regulatory methods, such as the Current Exposure Method (CEM) and the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR), simplify exposure measurement by applying fixed conversion factors to nominal values or notional exposures. Although these methods provide transparency and comparability, they also tend to overstate exposure, particularly for portfolios that benefit from diversification, netting, and collateralization. They do not capture the nonlinear relationships between market factors and derivative valuations, nor do they fully recognize the impact of collateral management practices that have become standard in the post-crisis OTC derivatives market.

To overcome these limitations, the Internal Model Method (IMM) was developed to allow financial institutions, subject to supervisory approval, to estimate exposures through stochastic simulation. Under the IMM, exposure is derived from Monte Carlo models that simulate the joint dynamics of relevant market variables and the portfolio’s future values. This enables a more realistic representation of risk by incorporating path dependency, netting, and collateral adjustments. The method aligns the assessment of regulatory exposure with economic substance, offering a risk-sensitive framework consistent with modern portfolio management principles.

However, the implementation of internal models is data-intensive and computationally demanding. Many smaller institutions continue to rely on standardized approaches, which, while conservative, do not reflect the economic benefits of risk mitigation. This divergence between simplified and model-based approaches creates a persistent regulatory and methodological gap. The challenge is to balance the need for prudential simplicity with the goal of accurate, risk-sensitive exposure assessment.

The purpose of this thesis is to contribute to this ongoing discussion by developing and implementing a simulation-based framework for estimating counterparty credit exposure. Using a Monte Carlo approach, the study quantifies expected exposure profiles, incorporates netting and collateral effects, and calculates Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) values under different assumptions. The framework is designed to compare results from the Internal Model Method (IMM) with those obtained from standardized regulatory approaches such as CEM and SA-CCR. By analyzing these differences, the study seeks to illustrate how modeling choices and contractual arrangements influence measured exposure and corresponding capital requirements.

The specific objectives of the research are as follows:
1. To construct a simulation-based model of counterparty exposure using realistic stochastic processes for underlying market variables.  
2. To estimate key exposure metrics, including expected exposure (EE), expected positive exposure (EPE), and potential future exposure (PFE).  
3. To compute the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) under alternative netting and collateralization settings.  
4. To compare exposure outcomes obtained from advanced model-based methods with those from standardized regulatory formulas.  
5. To evaluate the implications of these findings for risk management practices and regulatory compliance.

The study aims to demonstrate that simulation-based estimation provides a more accurate and informative perspective on counterparty risk than simplified formula-based methods. This insight has both regulatory relevance and practical importance for institutions managing large derivative portfolios.

## 1.3 Scope and Limitations

This thesis focuses on counterparty credit risk in the context of interest rate derivatives, particularly interest rate swaps (IRS), which constitute the largest share of global over-the-counter (OTC) derivative exposure. Interest rate swaps are chosen for their prevalence, transparency, and analytical tractability. The study employs simulated market data to generate exposure profiles and does not rely on proprietary or confidential data from financial institutions. The emphasis is therefore on methodological clarity and theoretical consistency rather than on empirical calibration or validation.

Several limitations apply to this research.  
First, the analysis is restricted to the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and does not extend to other valuation adjustments such as Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA), Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA), or Capital Valuation Adjustment (KVA). These extensions, while relevant for comprehensive pricing frameworks, are beyond the immediate scope of this study.  
Second, the modeling assumes a single-asset class exposure and excludes wrong-way risk effects, cross-asset correlations, and dynamic credit spread modeling. These simplifications ensure computational feasibility and focus on the main drivers of CVA under controlled assumptions.  
Third, no empirical backtesting or statistical validation is performed. Instead, simulated data are used to explore conceptual relationships and illustrate the impact of netting and collateralization on exposure and CVA outcomes.

Within these boundaries, the study contributes to a clearer understanding of how simulation-based methods can enhance the accuracy of counterparty risk measurement. It also offers a basis for comparing the efficiency and conservatism of alternative regulatory approaches. The findings are expected to support ongoing discussions on the balance between model risk, regulatory simplicity, and the pursuit of economically meaningful capital requirements.
