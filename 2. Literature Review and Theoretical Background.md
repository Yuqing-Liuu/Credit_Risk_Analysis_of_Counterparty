## 2. Literature Review and Theoretical Background
2.1 Overview of Counterparty Credit Risk

Following the 2008 financial crisis, extensive academic and regulatory research has focused on the quantification and mitigation of counterparty credit risk (CCR). CCR is defined as the potential loss a financial institution may suffer if a counterparty defaults before the final settlement of contractual obligations. The distinctive feature of CCR is that exposure is stochastic, changing with underlying market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and credit spreads (Gregory, 2015).

CCR arises mainly from over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities financing transactions. The exposure at default (EAD) depends on the future market value of outstanding positions, while the probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) represent the credit risk parameters (BCBS, 2011). Estimating EAD over time requires a dynamic modeling framework, which motivates the use of simulation-based approaches such as Monte Carlo analysis.



2.2 Credit Valuation Adjustment in the Literature

The Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) quantifies the market value of counterparty credit risk by adjusting the fair value of a derivative portfolio for the possibility of counterparty default prior to maturity. It is formally expressed as:

$$
CVA = (1 - R) \int_0^T DF(t) \times EE(t) \times dPD(t)
$$


where R is the recovery rate, DF(t) the discount factor, EE(t) the expected exposure at time t, and dPD(t) the marginal default probability.

This representation, introduced in studies such as Brigo and Morini (2010) and Gregory (2015), has become a standard formulation in both academic and regulatory frameworks. Early work treated exposure as deterministic, while later research introduced stochastic credit spread models, wrong-way risk, and collateral adjustments (Brigo and Vrins, 2016).

Recent contributions expand the concept to a broader class of valuation adjustments collectively referred to as xVA, including DVA, FVA, and KVA, each addressing different components of counterparty and funding risk (Green and Kenyon, 2015). Within this literature, CVA remains the adjustment most directly linked to regulatory capital requirements.



2.3 Evolution of Regulatory Approaches

The regulatory treatment of counterparty exposure has evolved in parallel with academic advances. Under Basel II, exposure was measured through the Current Exposure Method (CEM), which applied fixed add-on factors by product type and maturity. Although straightforward, CEM ignored diversification, netting, and collateralization effects, often leading to conservative exposure estimates (BCBS, 2011).

Basel III introduced the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) capital charge, recognizing credit spread risk as a separate source of loss. It also allowed banks to adopt the Internal Model Method (IMM), which estimates exposure through Monte Carlo simulation, provided they meet certain modeling and validation requirements (BCBS, 2015). 

In Basel III and subsequent Basel IV reforms, the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) replaced CEM. SA-CCR aims to balance simplicity with greater risk sensitivity, explicitly incorporating netting sets, collateral recognition, and supervisory delta factors (BCBS, 2017). Studies such as Mathur and Skoglund (2013) demonstrate that IMM provides smoother and more realistic exposure profiles than standardized methods, though at higher operational and computational costs.



2.4 Netting and Collateralization under ISDA Agreements

The mitigation of counterparty exposure relies heavily on legal and operational mechanisms defined by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). The ISDA Master Agreement establishes the framework for close-out netting, allowing counterparties to offset mutual obligations across transactions and thereby reduce the total exposure to a single net amount (ISDA, 2019).

Collateralization, defined through the Credit Support Annex (CSA), further mitigates credit risk by requiring counterparties to post collateral whenever exposure exceeds predefined thresholds. Collateral amounts are recalculated frequently through margin calls, ensuring exposures remain within contractual limits (Brigo and Morini, 2010).

From a modeling standpoint, netting compresses exposure distributions, while collateralization truncates the upper tail of potential loss outcomes (Pykhtin and Zhu, 2007). Simulation frameworks account for these effects by adjusting exposure paths for netting sets and collateral thresholds, resulting in a more realistic estimation of potential future exposures and CVA.



2.5 Simulation-Based Exposure Modeling

Monte Carlo simulation has become the predominant approach for modeling counterparty exposure under the Internal Model Method (IMM). It enables the joint simulation of market and credit risk factors and the calculation of portfolio values across thousands of future scenarios (Glasserman, 2003). 

From the resulting exposure distribution, several risk measures can be derived:

- Expected Exposure (EE): the mean of positive exposures at a specific time point.
- Expected Positive Exposure (EPE): the time-weighted average of expected exposures.
- Potential Future Exposure (PFE): a percentile of the exposure distribution that reflects a high-confidence limit on exposure.

Monte Carlo simulation can also incorporate wrong-way risk, where exposure and counterparty credit quality are correlated—an aspect ignored by standardized methods (Brigo and Vrins, 2016). Despite its computational intensity, the Monte Carlo approach remains the most flexible and accurate method for estimating exposure and CVA, as it captures nonlinearities and contractual effects such as netting and collateralization.
