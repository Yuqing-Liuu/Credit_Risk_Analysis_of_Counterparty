## 2. Literature Review and Theoretical Background
2.1 Overview of Counterparty Credit Risk

Following the 2008 financial crisis, extensive academic and regulatory research has focused on the quantification and mitigation of counterparty credit risk (CCR). CCR is defined as the potential loss a financial institution may suffer if a counterparty defaults before the final settlement of contractual obligations. The distinctive feature of CCR is that exposure is stochastic, changing with underlying market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and credit spreads (Gregory, 2015).

CCR arises mainly from over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities financing transactions. The exposure at default (EAD) depends on the future market value of outstanding positions, while the probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) represent the credit risk parameters (BCBS, 2011). Estimating EAD over time requires a dynamic modeling framework, which motivates the use of simulation-based approaches such as Monte Carlo analysis.



2.2 Credit Valuation Adjustment in the Literature

The Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) quantifies the market value of counterparty credit risk by adjusting the fair value of a derivative portfolio for the possibility of counterparty default prior to maturity. It is formally expressed as:

$$
CVA = (1 - R) \int_0^T DF(t) \times EE(t) \times dPD(t)
$$


where R is the recovery rate, DF(t) the discount factor, EE(t) the expected exposure at time t, and dPD(t) the marginal default probability.

This representation, introduced in studies such as Brigo and Morini (2010) and Gregory (2015), has become a standard formulation in both academic and regulatory frameworks. Early work treated exposure as deterministic, while later research introduced stochastic credit spread models, wrong-way risk, and collateral adjustments (Brigo and Vrins, 2016).

Recent contributions expand the concept to a broader class of valuation adjustments collectively referred to as xVA, including DVA, FVA, and KVA, each addressing different components of counterparty and funding risk (Green and Kenyon, 2015). Within this literature, CVA remains the adjustment most directly linked to regulatory capital requirements.



2.3 Evolution of Regulatory Approaches

The regulatory treatment of counterparty exposure has evolved in parallel with academic advances. Under Basel II, exposure was measured through the Current Exposure Method (CEM), which applied fixed add-on factors by product type and maturity. Although straightforward, CEM ignored diversification, netting, and collateralization effects, often leading to conservative exposure estimates (BCBS, 2011).

Basel III introduced the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) capital charge, recognizing credit spread risk as a separate source of loss. It also allowed banks to adopt the Internal Model Method (IMM), which estimates exposure through Monte Carlo simulation, provided they meet certain modeling and validation requirements (BCBS, 2015). 

In Basel III and subsequent Basel IV reforms, the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) replaced CEM. SA-CCR aims to balance simplicity with greater risk sensitivity, explicitly incorporating netting sets, collateral recognition, and supervisory delta factors (BCBS, 2017). Studies such as Mathur and Skoglund (2013) demonstrate that IMM provides smoother and more realistic exposure profiles than standardized methods, though at higher operational and computational costs.



2.4 Netting and Collateralization under ISDA Agreements

The mitigation of counterparty exposure relies heavily on legal and operational mechanisms defined by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). The ISDA Master Agreement establishes the framework for close-out netting, allowing counterparties to offset mutual obligations across transactions and thereby reduce the total exposure to a single net amount (ISDA, 2019).

Collateralization, defined through the Credit Support Annex (CSA), further mitigates credit risk by requiring counterparties to post collateral whenever exposure exceeds predefined thresholds. Collateral amounts are recalculated frequently through margin calls, ensuring exposures remain within contractual limits (Brigo and Morini, 2010).

From a modeling standpoint, netting compresses exposure distributions, while collateralization truncates the upper tail of potential loss outcomes (Pykhtin and Zhu, 2007). Simulation frameworks account for these effects by adjusting exposure paths for netting sets and collateral thresholds, resulting in a more realistic estimation of potential future exposures and CVA.



2.5 Simulation-Based Exposure Modeling

Monte Carlo simulation has become the predominant approach for modeling counterparty exposure under the Internal Model Method (IMM). It enables the joint simulation of market and credit risk factors and the calculation of portfolio values across thousands of future scenarios (Glasserman, 2003). 

From the resulting exposure distribution, several risk measures can be derived:

- Expected Exposure (EE): the mean of positive exposures at a specific time point.
- Expected Positive Exposure (EPE): the time-weighted average of expected exposures.
- Potential Future Exposure (PFE): a percentile of the exposure distribution that reflects a high-confidence limit on exposure.

Monte Carlo simulation can also incorporate wrong-way risk, where exposure and counterparty credit quality are correlated—an aspect ignored by standardized methods (Brigo and Vrins, 2016). Despite its computational intensity, the Monte Carlo approach remains the most flexible and accurate method for estimating exposure and CVA, as it captures nonlinearities and contractual effects such as netting and collateralization.

# CHAPTER II. LITERATURE REVIEW AND THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

## 2.1 Introduction

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical and regulatory foundations underlying counterparty credit risk (CCR) and the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA). The literature on this topic evolved significantly following the global financial crisis of 2008, which revealed the critical interaction between market and credit risks in derivative transactions. The chapter reviews the development of CCR concepts, the emergence of CVA as both a pricing and regulatory construct, and the methodologies that have been proposed to quantify exposure. It also outlines the historical evolution of regulatory frameworks under the Basel Accords, the mitigating role of netting and collateralization, and the development of simulation-based approaches that culminated in the Internal Model Method (IMM). The objective is to synthesize prior academic and professional research to establish a theoretical base for the model and empirical framework developed in subsequent chapters.

## 2.2 Counterparty Credit Risk and Its Measurement

Counterparty credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial contract defaults before the final settlement of all cash flows, thereby causing a loss to the non-defaulting party (Gregory, 2015). It differs fundamentally from traditional credit risk, which arises from one-directional obligations such as loans or bonds. In the case of derivatives, exposures are bilateral and time-dependent, meaning that either party can be in-the-money or out-of-the-money depending on market movements (Brigo & Morini, 2010).

Mathematically, the exposure at time \( t \) is given by:

$$
E(t) = \max[V(t), 0]
$$

where \( V(t) \) represents the mark-to-market value of the contract at time \( t \). Expected exposure (EE) is defined as the statistical expectation of positive exposures,  
\( EE(t) = \mathbb{E}[\max(V(t),0)] \),  
and the expected positive exposure (EPE) is obtained by averaging \( EE(t) \) over time (Pykhtin & Zhu, 2007). These quantities serve as fundamental building blocks in the measurement of counterparty credit risk, forming the link between economic exposure and regulatory capital.

The distribution of exposure is shaped by market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and credit spreads. For derivative portfolios, this requires the joint simulation of multiple stochastic factors and contractual dependencies. The resulting exposure profile is thus a dynamic and path-dependent function, making analytical estimation infeasible in most cases. As a result, simulation techniques—particularly Monte Carlo methods—have become indispensable in both academic research and industry practice for modeling CCR (Glasserman, 2003).

## 2.3 Credit Valuation Adjustment: Concept and Mathematical Definition

The Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) represents the market value of counterparty credit risk. It is defined as the difference between the risk-free portfolio value and the value accounting for the counterparty’s potential default (Brigo & Morini, 2010). In its simplest continuous form, the unilateral CVA for a single counterparty can be expressed as:

$$
CVA = (1 - R) \int_0^T DF(t) \times EE(t) \times dPD(t)
$$

where \( R \) denotes the recovery rate, \( DF(t) \) the discount factor to time \( t \), \( EE(t) \) the expected exposure, and \( PD(t) \) the cumulative default probability up to time \( t \) (Gregory, 2015). This integral represents the discounted expected loss over time, capturing both market-driven exposure fluctuations and the credit quality of the counterparty.

CVA became a key risk metric after the financial crisis, when it was observed that changes in credit spreads could lead to significant mark-to-market losses even in the absence of defaults (BCBS, 2011). According to Green and Kenyon (2015), CVA serves not only as a valuation adjustment but also as a mechanism linking pricing models to capital requirements, reflecting the integration of credit risk into market-based valuation frameworks.

The literature distinguishes between two primary interpretations of CVA:  
(1) the *accounting CVA*, which adjusts the fair value of derivative contracts to reflect counterparty default risk under risk-neutral valuation, and  
(2) the *regulatory CVA*, which measures the potential variation in CVA due to credit spread volatility and forms the basis for the CVA capital charge (BCBS, 2015). Both share the same mathematical foundation but differ in their practical application—one focusing on valuation accuracy, the other on capital adequacy.

## 2.4 Basel Regulatory Developments and the CVA Capital Charge

The regulatory treatment of counterparty credit risk has evolved substantially since the introduction of the first Basel Accord in 1988. Under Basel I, credit exposures from derivative contracts were addressed only indirectly, using add-on percentages that depended on maturity and asset class (BCBS, 1988). The subsequent Basel II framework (2004) introduced a more risk-sensitive structure but still relied heavily on the Current Exposure Method (CEM), which combined the current mark-to-market exposure with a fixed add-on to estimate potential future exposure (BCBS, 2005). While simple, CEM failed to recognize diversification effects from netting and collateralization, leading to conservative exposure estimates (Pykhtin & Zhu, 2007).

The global financial crisis of 2008 demonstrated that valuation losses could also result from credit spread volatility rather than actual defaults. This observation prompted regulators to expand the definition of counterparty risk to include mark-to-market effects. Basel III, published in 2010, introduced a specific capital charge for CVA to capture the risk of credit spread changes (BCBS, 2011). The CVA capital charge requires banks to hold capital against potential losses stemming from deterioration in counterparties’ credit quality, even when no default occurs.

Two approaches were established under Basel III for calculating CVA capital:  
1. The *standardized CVA charge*, which uses risk weights based on counterparty ratings and effective maturities; and  
2. The *advanced CVA charge*, or CVA-Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach, which allows institutions to use internal models to simulate credit spread movements (BCBS, 2015).

Later revisions, such as the *Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk* (SA-CCR), further refined exposure estimation by replacing the outdated CEM. SA-CCR introduced a more risk-sensitive framework by considering notional amounts, replacement costs, and supervisory deltas (BCBS, 2017). These developments collectively demonstrate the regulatory trend toward balancing prudence and accuracy through model-based and standardized methodologies.

Basel IV, the latest iteration of the framework, continues to emphasize standardization and comparability. The new *SA-CVA* approach simplifies implementation while maintaining capital sensitivity to credit spread changes (BCBS, 2020). As a result, the evolution of regulatory CVA reflects the broader tension between quantitative sophistication and supervisory simplicity that characterizes post-crisis financial regulation.

## 2.5 Netting, Collateralization, and Wrong-Way Risk

Netting and collateralization are two primary mechanisms that mitigate counterparty risk in derivatives markets. Netting allows for the aggregation of multiple derivative positions under a single legal agreement, offsetting positive and negative mark-to-market values to determine a single net exposure (Gregory, 2015). Empirical evidence indicates that netting can reduce gross exposures by up to 90% depending on portfolio composition and correlation (ISDA, 2019).

Collateralization further reduces residual risk through the posting of collateral when exposure exceeds pre-defined thresholds, as governed by the ISDA Credit Support Annex (CSA). Collateral can take the form of cash or high-quality securities, and its effectiveness depends on factors such as margin frequency, minimum transfer amounts, and the quality of eligible collateral (ISDA, 2019). According to Brigo and Capponi (2014), collateralization transforms counterparty risk into funding and liquidity risk, highlighting the trade-offs embedded in risk mitigation.

A critical aspect of counterparty risk modeling is *wrong-way risk (WWR)*—a situation where exposure to a counterparty increases precisely when the counterparty’s credit quality deteriorates. This correlation amplifies potential losses and can lead to substantial underestimation of risk if ignored (Brigo & Vrins, 2016). Modeling WWR typically requires joint stochastic processes for exposure and creditworthiness, which significantly increases computational complexity. For this reason, most regulatory frameworks, including SA-CCR, allow for conservative approximations that implicitly account for WWR through higher capital multipliers.

In practice, effective risk management depends on a combination of netting, collateralization, and conservative capital charges that collectively limit systemic vulnerability. These mechanisms form the operational foundation of modern counterparty credit risk control, as codified in the Basel III and IV frameworks.

## 2.6 Simulation-Based Exposure Modeling and the Internal Model Method

Monte Carlo simulation techniques have become standard tools for quantifying counterparty exposure, particularly for portfolios with nonlinear payoffs or optionality (Glasserman, 2003). By simulating multiple paths of underlying risk factors, these methods provide a full probability distribution of potential future exposures. This allows the computation of expected exposure (EE), potential future exposure (PFE), and effective expected positive exposure (EEPE), all of which feed into the calculation of exposure-at-default (EAD).

Within the Basel III framework, the *Internal Model Method (IMM)* was introduced as a regulatory approach that explicitly relies on simulation-based modeling. The IMM defines the exposure at default as:

$$
EAD = \alpha \times EEPE
$$

where α is a regulatory multiplier, typically 1.4, used to account for model risk (BCBS, 2011). The EEPE is the weighted average of EPE over time, representing a smoothed measure of exposure. According to Mathur and Skoglund (2013), this formulation allows banks to align capital requirements more closely with economic exposure while recognizing the mitigation effects of netting and collateral.

The primary advantage of simulation-based models lies in their risk sensitivity and flexibility. They can incorporate portfolio effects, capture path dependency, and adapt to complex derivatives. However, these benefits come at the cost of high computational demands and extensive data requirements. As noted by Green, Kenyon, and Dennis (2014), maintaining and validating such models requires robust infrastructure and rigorous governance to satisfy supervisory expectations.

Although the IMM provides a more accurate representation of counterparty risk, its implementation is limited to large institutions with the necessary quantitative resources. Smaller banks continue to rely on standardized approaches, creating an uneven landscape between simplicity and sophistication. Nonetheless, simulation-based modeling remains the cornerstone of advanced CCR measurement and continues to evolve with improvements in computational technology and model design.

## 2.7 Summary

This chapter reviewed the main theoretical and regulatory developments surrounding counterparty credit risk and the Credit Valuation Adjustment. It outlined the progression from early exposure estimation methods under Basel I and II to the integrated treatment of CCR and CVA under Basel III and IV. The literature emphasizes that the accurate modeling of exposure and credit risk interaction requires a combination of economic realism and computational precision. Mechanisms such as netting and collateralization significantly reduce risk, while Monte Carlo simulation provides the most comprehensive framework for quantifying exposure in complex portfolios.

The Internal Model Method (IMM) represents the regulatory recognition of simulation-based modeling as the most risk-sensitive approach to exposure estimation. However, it also highlights the ongoing trade-off between accuracy, transparency, and operational feasibility. The next chapter builds on these concepts to present the detailed regulatory framework for CVA capital charges, comparing the standardized and internal model approaches and evaluating their implications for financial institutions.
